    "Title": "Is saliva a reliable biofluid for the detection of COVID-19?",
    "Authors": "Damla Torul 1, Mehmet Melih Omezli 1",
    "Abstract": "This review aimed to assess the current evidence on the diagnostic potential of saliva regarding the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The literature published until May 24, 2020 was searched in the Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar databases with the keywords \"COVID-19\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"2019-nCoV\", \"oral fluid\", \"saliva\", and \"diagnosis\", individually and in combination, and 11 studies that explored the efficacy of saliva in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in different patient groups were found. Together, these studies suggest that saliva is a safe and reliable tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Further, saliva offers enhanced safety as well as logistical and economic benefits as compared to the current methods used to diagnose COVID-19. However, there is still limited evidence in the literature to make a definitive, clinically appropriate decision. The ideal specimen for the detection of acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still an issue under investigation. Thus, new studies with large sample sets for the validation of easy, safe and reliable methods applicable for large-scale testing are immediately required."

    "Abstract": "Background:To face the current COVID-19 pandemic, diagnostic tools are essential. It is recommended to use real-time RT-PCR for RNA viruses in order (a) to perform a rapid and accurate diagnostic, (b) to guide patient care and management and (c) to guide epidemiological strategies. Further studies are warranted to define the role of serological diagnosis and a possible correlation between serological response and prognosis.Objectives:The aim was to guide clinical microbiologists in the use of these diagnostic tests and clinicians in the interpretation of their results.Sources:A search of literature was performed through PubMed and Google Scholar using the keywords SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnosis, SARS-CoV-2 immune response, SARS-CoV-2 serology/antibody testing, coronavirus diagnosis.Content:The present review discusses performances, limitations and use of current and future diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.Implications:Real-time RT-PCR remains the reference method for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, notwithstanding its varying sensitivity according to the time of infection, serology represents a valid asset (a) to try to solve possible discrepancies between a highly suggestive clinical and radiological presentation and negative RT-PCR, (b) to solve discrepancies between different PCR assays and (c) for epidemiological purposes."

    "Title": "Point-of-Care PCR Assays for COVID-19 Detection",
    "Authors": "Niharika Gupta 1, Shine Augustine 1, Tarun Narayan 2, Alan O'Riordan 2, Asmita Das 1, D Kumar 3, John H T Luong 4, Bansi D Malhotra 1",
    "Abstract": "Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the world's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection. The distinct features of digital PCR and electrochemical PCR are detailed along with the challenges. The potential of CRISPR/Cas technology for POC diagnostics is also highlighted. Commercial RT-PCR POC systems approved by various agencies for COVID-19 detection are discussed."

    "Title": "Roadmap to the Bioanalytical Testing of COVID-19: From Sample Collection to Disease Surveillance",
    "Authors": "Amin Hosseini 1, Richa Pandey 2, Enas Osman 1, Amanda Victorious 1, Feng Li 3 4, Tohid Didar 1 5, Leyla Soleymani 1 2",
    "Abstract": "The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has led to a global pandemic with tremendous mortality, morbidity, and economic loss. The current lack of effective vaccines and treatments places tremendous value on widespread screening, early detection, and contact tracing of COVID-19 for controlling its spread and minimizing the resultant health and societal impact. Bioanalytical diagnostic technologies have played a critical role in the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic and will continue to be foundational in the prevention of the subsequent waves of this pandemic along with future infectious disease outbreaks. In this Review, we aim at presenting a roadmap to the bioanalytical testing of COVID-19, with a focus on the performance metrics as well as the limitations of various techniques. The state-of-the-art technologies, mostly limited to centralized laboratories, set the clinical metrics against which the emerging technologies are measured. Technologies for point-of-care and do-it-yourself testing are rapidly emerging, which open the route for testing in the community, at home, and at points-of-entry to widely screen and monitor individuals for enabling normal life despite of an infectious disease pandemic. The combination of different classes of diagnostic technologies (centralized and point-of-care and relying on multiple biomarkers) are needed for effective diagnosis, treatment selection, prognosis, patient monitoring, and epidemiological surveillance in the event of major pandemics such as COVID-19."

    "Abstract": "Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was initially detected in Wuhan city, China. Chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia have been investigated mostly in China, and there is very little information available on the radiological findings occurring in other populations. In this study, we aimed to describe the characteristics of chest CT findings in confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Iranian population, based on a time classification.Methods. Eighty-nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR test, who were admitted to non-ICU wards and underwent a chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. Descriptive evaluation of radiologic findings was performed using a classification based on the time interval between the initiation of the symptoms and chest CT-scan.Results. The median age of patients was 58.0 years, and the median time interval from the onset of symptoms to CT scan evaluation was 7 days. Most patients had bilateral (94.4%) and multifocal (91.0%) lung involvement with peripheral distribution (60.7%). Also, most patients showed involvement of all five lobes (77.5%). Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (84.3%) and mixed GGO with consolidation (80.9%) were the most common identified patterns. We also found that as the time interval between symptoms and CT scan evaluation increased, the predominant pattern changed from GGO to mixed pattern and then to elongated-containing and band-like-opacities-containing pattern; on the other hand, the percentage of lung involvement increased.Conclusions. Bilateral multifocal GGO, and mixed GGO with consolidation were the most common patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia in our study. However, these patterns might change according to the time interval from symptoms."

    "Authors": "Farbod Mahmoudinobar 1, Dustin Britton 1, Jin Kim Montclare 1 2 3 4",
    "Abstract": "To combat the enduring and dangerous spread of COVID-19, many innovations to rapid diagnostics have been developed based on proteinprotein interactions of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins to increase testing accessibility. These antigen tests have most prominently been developed using the lateral flow assay (LFA) test platform which has the benefit of administration at point-of-care, delivering quick results, lower cost, and does not require skilled personnel. However, they have gained criticism for an inferior sensitivity. In the last year, much attention has been given to creating a rapid LFA test for detection of COVID-19 antigens that can address its high limit of detection while retaining the advantages of rapid antibodyantigen interaction. In this review, a summary of these proteinprotein interactions as well as the challenges, benefits, and recent improvements to protein based LFA for detection of COVID-19 are discussed."

    "Abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected all aspects of human life. Rapid, accurate, sensitive and user friendly detection method is urgently needed to facilitate early intervention and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a one-pot visual SARS-CoV-2 detection system named \"opvCRISPR\" by integrating reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and Cas12a cleavage in a single reaction system. We demonstrate that the collateral activity against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporters of activated Cas12a triggered by RT-LAMP amplicon increases detection sensitivity and makes detection results observable with naked eye. The opvCRISPR enables detection at nearly single molecule level in 45 min. We validate this method with 50 SARS-CoV-2 potentially infected clinical samples. The opvCRISPR diagnostic results provide 100% agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved quantitative RT-PCR assay. The opvCRISPR holds great potential for SARS-CoV-2 detection in next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics."
