1,2783254,"Preserving hospital functions requires effective infection control strategies and measures. Because many hospitals in Taiwan experienced the SARS pandemic in 2003, measures were taken against the incoming COVID-19 outbreak at the beginning of the epidemic. In the following sections, we summarize emergency response strategies and infection control measures that hospitals can apply under an evolving epidemic. Herein, we report practical and detailed measures adopted by Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital (KMUH), a 1600-bed tertiary care medical center in southern Taiwan. Many of hospital staff members experienced the SARS outbreak in 2003 and cared for confirmed cases. Annual drills to cope with the potential re-emergence of SARS have been conducted for 17 years. Although an emergency response plan against emerging infectious diseases is revised annually, timely and practical modifications of the plan were made to confront the COVID-19 outbreak."

These fecal samples had been confirmed positive for PEDV by RT-PCR or by using an Anigen Rapid PED Ag Test Kit (Animal Genetics Inc., Korea) [11] . PEDV-positive fecal samples were diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7.2) to make 10% (V/V) suspensions. The suspensions were vortexed and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 rpm. The supernatants were collected for RT-PCR or nested RT-PCR."

4,1629935,"Calls have been made to reduce survivor exposure to the virus by postponing adjuvant treatments or elective surgeries for ""stable patients"" 17 and minimizing extended treatments whenever possible. 64 These measures may not only limit exposure but also decrease potentially unnecessary treatment-related financial toxicity at this critical time. Additionally, there is a critical need-now more than ever before-to promote financial planning among patients and improve the frequency and content of patient-provider communication concerning expected OOP expenses. 65 It is essential to adopt an approach of shared decision making, involving patients not only in conversations regarding goals of care, but also discussions involving access to care, availability of caregiver support, and exposures to financial toxicity. This also raises the need for early palliative care intervention and incorporation within treatment plans. Although the capacity for palliative care may be limited at this time due to increased demand, 66 experiences from other institutions do provide a framework to improve delivery of high-quality palliative care during the pandemic. 67, 68 These measures, however, do not specifically address patients with cancer, as of yet. The potential vulnerability of this patient population, both to the infection itself as well as the economic ripples of the pandemic, highlight an urgent need for future paradigms specifically addressing cancer survivors."
5,386823,"The causative pathogen of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been identified as a new member of the coronavirus family that exhibits a broad range of hosts, infecting many mammalian and avian species and causing upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and CNS diseases [1, 2] . Two known human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43, which cause up to one-third of all cases of common cold, were also found to infect the CNS [3] . Our recent study of the SARS epidemic found that the spike protein, a surface antigen determining the tropism of coronavirus, had the strongest response to positive selection pressure [4] . We noticed that a few patients with SARS in hospitals in Guangzhou City, China, exhibited central nervous symptoms during the course of their illnesses. Lau and colleagues [5] reported that a CSF sample obtained from a 32-year-old woman with SARS tested positive for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by RT-PCR, indicating that SARS-CoV might cause an infection in the CNS of patients with SARS. In the present study, we isolated a SARS-CoV strain from a brain tissue specimen obtained during autopsy from a patient with SARS who became severely sick and showed significant central nervous symptoms during the course of his illness. Furthermore, we investigated the immunopathological mechanism of brain damage in the patient with SARS. In this study, we detected a high level of monokine induced by IFN-g (Mig), a member of CXC family [6, 7] , in the patient's brain and found that gliocytes were a major source for Mig production in the brain. All results suggested that Mig was involved in the immunopathology of the brain on invasion of SARS-CoV."
6,1262549,"The FCoV virion is mainly composed of the nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M), and peplomer spike (S) proteins [13] . FCoV has been classified into serotypes I and II based on the amino acid sequence of its S protein [7, 10] . Both serotypes consist of two biotypes: FIPV and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) [22] . FECV infection is asymptomatic in cats; however, FIPV infection causes FIP. Some proteins encoded by the coronavirus genome show ion channel activity. For example, the 3a and E proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 4a protein of human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E have been reported to show ion channel activity [15, 25, 26] . Viral proteins with ion channel activity have also been reported in other viruses and have collectively been termed ''viroporins'' [12] . The involvement of viroporins in replication and budding has been confirmed in influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The replication of these viruses was shown to be markedly inhibited by viroporin inhibitors. Amantadine, 4,4 0 -disothiocyano-2,2 0stilbenedisulphonic acid (DIDS), and hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) have been identified as viroporin inhibitors. Wilson et al. [25] reported that HMA, an inhibitor of the E protein ion channel, inhibits viral replication of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HCoV-229E, but the antiviral effect of HMA on FIPV has not been clarified."

The features of early-stage COVID-19 include GGOs-based lesions with rare small size consolidation mainly distributed in the peripheral and posterior part of the lung. Some patients' pulmonary lesions are small and focal, which should capture physicians' attention. The level of decreased CD4 + T cell, elevated CRP and LDH may prompt the severity of CT imaging."

9,1457612,"In December 2019, an outbreak of new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, also known as 2019-nCoV) infected pneumonia (COVID-19) was occurred in Wuhan, China and soon spread to other cities and countries. According to the epidemiological analysis conducted by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), 80.9% of the cases are mild/moderate pneumonia, and by February 11, the crude overall mortality rate is 2.3%. 1 As the epidemiological picture of COVID-19 is evolving daily, the global mortality rate of closed cases keeps rising ( www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ ). The clinical manifestations of most patients include fever, cough, shortness of breath and myalgia etc. , and radiographic evidence demonstrated pneumonia with multiple mottling and ground-glass opacity 2 . A fraction of patients in serious condition will proceed to complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm, which may account for the reasons for COVID-19 caused death. [3] [4] [5] Despite the relatively low fatality, the transmissibility of COVID-19 is proved to be high. Basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) of COVID-19 ranging from 1.4 to 6.47, while most of the modeling studies showed the R 0 value greater than 3. 6 , 7 SARS-CoV-2 belongs to lineage B of the beta-coronavirus family, the zoonotic-origin single-strand RNA viruses that are transmitted between animals and people. The four prevalent viruses of seven coronavirus family members, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause only the mild upper respiratory diseases, while the other two highly pathogenic strains, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, together with the new identified SARS-CoV-2 are regarded to pose the global threats to public health. The full-genome sequencing data from two groups revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 comprises of six major open reading frames (ORFs) and shares approximately 80% of similarity with SARS-CoV, but 98.65% nucleotide identity to partial RdRp gene and 96.2% identity to RaTG13 of SARS-like bat coronavirus strain, respectively. 8 , 9 Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Real-time reverse-transcript Polymerase Chain Reaction (real-time RT-PCR) is regarded as the ""gold-standard"" in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. 10 OC43 and MERS) and influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 subtype). 11 , 12 Despite the real-time RT-PCR is widely adopted as the standard diagnostic method of SARS-CoV-2 in China and worldwide, the limitation of this technology is obvious. The patients that are positive to RT-PCR tests can be diagnosed as SARS-CoV-2 infection, while negative to the tests cannot rule out the possibility. The increasing number of reports from local authorities addressed the unneglectable false-negative rate in the diagnosis of suspected cases, which poses much threat to the community and adds an extra burden to the epidemic prevention. For example, the chest CT scanning from 5 suspected cases demonstrated ground-glass opacity and/or mixed consolidation, yet the initial real-time RT-PCR test showed to be negative. After a few days, all the 5 cases tested for the second or third examinations had eventually confirmed to be positive to SARS-CoV-2. 13 Complementary to RT-PCR, pneumonia radiography provides strong evidence for the diagnosis. Nevertheless, more specific measurements, such as serologic methods are urgently needed in the supplement to the current diagnosis. Here we present the newly developed serological detection methods targeting the viral antibody, colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic (ICG) strip, that conducted in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, hoping to provide supplementary diagnostic approaches for the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients."
10,1627768,"Consistently with several recent reports regarding to CT findings of 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia (NCIP) [13] [14] [15] , our results showed that CT manifestations of NCIP were featured by predominant ground glass opacities (GGO) (67%) mixed with consolidations (30%), mainly peripheral (26%) or combined peripheral and central distributions (74%), bilateral (86%) and lower lung zones (96%) being mostly involved. Merely consolidation, central distribution only, pleural effusions or lymphadenopathy were relatively rarely seen. Initially the CT images might be GGO nodules or patchy GGO mostly peripherally distributed then consolidations and extensive distributions were seen when pneumonia progressed. Consolidation, air bronchogram, extensive distribution as well as multiple involved lung zones were more common in mortality group, suggesting a more severe clinical course for these abnormalities can be pathologically correlated with diffuse alveolar damage and similar conclusions can be drawn in H1N1 pneumonia, H5N1 pneumonia, H7N9 pneumonia and SARS [9, [16] [17] [18] . As members of the same virus family, NCIP shared much common ground with MERS and SARS in CT features. Subpleural and basilar airspace lesions with GGOs and consolidations were conspicuous CT characteristics of all three kinds of virus pneumonia, but pleural effusions are more common in patients who died of MERS [19] [20] [21] [22] . Comprehensively evaluated the CT features of NCIP, we calculated the CT score of each patient. The CT scores were much higher in mortality group compared to survival group (30 (IQR 7-13) vs 12 (IQR 11-43), 0.021), P = 0.021) on admission. In mortality group the scores markedly increased in a short time (12 (IQR 5-24.5) vs 20 (IQR 15-46), P = 0.042), suggesting a progressive course of NCIP. Although the CT scores were not diminished, they maintained a relatively stable level for a period of time in survival group (12 (IQR 6-12) vs 12 (IQR 6-15), P = 0.237), suggesting that it might take a long time to recover in chest imaging when NCIP was under controlled. We found an optimal cutoff value of a CT score of 24.5 (sensitivity of 85.6% and specificity of 84.5%) to predict mortality. We hope the simple scoring method according to CT scans may help triage patients and screening patients who need more aggressive treatment and closely monitoring. However, the efficacy of such approach to decrease mortality remains to be validated in future studies. Although a definite diagnosis of NCIP cannot be achieved by using imaging features alone for most viral pneumonia imaging patterns share similarity, the CT features summarized above might be helpful in differentiation various pathogens of pneumonia and in triage patients."
11,1126912,"Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019 and as of 3rd March 2020, more than 90,800 cases and 3100 deaths have been reported from 72 countries ( World Health Organisation (WHO) 2020 ). Most of the cases and deaths have occurred in Wuhan city in China where the outbreak started. As drugs or vaccines are not yet available, various non-pharmaceutical measures have been recommended to reduce the spread of infection, including hygiene and disinfection, improving environmental control, early detection and reporting, isolation, quarantine, use of personal protective equipment, social distancing and travel restrictions (( World Health Organization (WHO) 2014 ; Bell et al., 2006 ) ). In most pandemic plans, tiered strategies which target front line health workers first, followed by the general community, are usually defined. Yet many of these strategies have some level of controversy attached and lack a large evidence base . Some are starting to be phased out in some settings such as the use of thermal scanners at airports, due to a lack of evidence, especially for infections with pre-symptomatic transmission ( Gunaratnam et al., 2014 ) . However, the use of other interventions continues to be debated."
12,2037885,"One of the reasons underpinning the conflicting evidences published so far on steroid therapy in viral respiratory infections and pneumonia could lie in the heterogeneity of the studies included in the meta-analysis assessing the mixed results of the effects of different GCs formulations (both short and long acting), given without considering the two different pathophysiological phases of the infection. In fact, if in one hand, supraphysiological dose of exogenous GCs have been shown to exerts detrimental effects in the early phase (by increasing the plasma viral load), one can argue the possibility to restrain the cytokine storm of the second, and more harmful, phase suppressing the immune overreaction by steroid treatment [19] . Moreover, in critically ill patients, the HPA axis may be unable to produce sufficient amount of corticosteroids, leading to critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI) [20] . Although the pathological features and clinical progression of COVID-19 resemble those seen in other coronavirus infections for which various standardised steroid protocols have been proposed, recent WHO guidance on the clinical management of COVID-19 advises against corticosteroids, unless indicated for another reason [21] . Adrenal insufficiency (AI) represent such a condition, in which the rationale to a prompt correction of GC therapy is not addressed to treat lung disease, but rather is aimed to supplement the abnormal adrenal function and, thus, to save patients' life. However, specific indications have been missing, and current standards of care actually suggest increasing the GC dose if COVID-19 infection is suspected, applying the ""sick-day-rule"" [22] ."

It would be interesting to test if robotics might be used in questioning or treating the infected or suspected patients, which will definitely decrease the possibility of exposure of health workers."

15,628355,"cific for viral antigens and cause a loss in the number of T cells with other specificities. In immunologically naïve hosts, viruses will induce T cell responses that, dependent on the MHC, recognize a distinct hierarchy of virus-encoded T cell epitopes. This hierarchy can change if the host has previously encountered another pathogen that elicited a memory pool of T cells specific to a cross-reactive epitope. This heterologous immunity can deviate the normal immune response and result in either beneficial or harmful effects on the host. Each host has a unique T cell repertoire caused by the random DNA rearrangement that created it, so the specific T cells that create the epitope hierarchy differ between individuals. This ""private specificity"" seems of little significance in the T cell response of a naïve host to infection, but it is of profound importance under conditions of heterologous immunity, where a small subset of a cross-reactive memory pool may expand and dominate a response. Examples are given of how the private specificities of immune responses under conditions of heterologous immunity influence the pathogenesis of murine and human viral infections."
16,931934,"Finally, international communities, especially in other lowand middle-income countries with potential COVID-19 outbreaks, should learn early how to protect their healthcare workers. Furthermore, the COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported to have surged in South Korea, Japan, Italy, and Iran in the past few days [2] . The increase in awareness of personal protection, sufficient PPE, and proper preparedness and response would play an important role in lowering the risk of infection for healthcare workers."
17,1191879,"(b) The M protein was cotranslationaily Nglycosylated, as demonstrated by inhibition of glycosylation by the addition of tunicamycin to the growth medium and by cleavage of the carbohydrates by N-glycosidase F. This finding clearly implied that PEDV should not be grouped with the coronaviruses of antigenic group II, which are, for unknown reasons, predominantly Oglycosylated (10) . Interestingly, M of PEDV appeared to be poorly if at all glycosylated when expressed by a recombinant baculovirus. Poor glycosylation of coronavirus (21) and influenza virus (22) glycoproteins by the baculovirus expression system has also been observed by others. In order to be glycosylated, the M protein has to be integrated in the ER. In the absence of a cleavable signal sequence, this may be achieved through each one of the three membrane-spanning domains common to all of the M proteins of coronaviruses (I0). Thus, provided that the construct inserted into the recombinant baculovirus did not contain undetected sequence errors, it may be concluded that the Sf9 insect cells did not accept the signal provided by the putative transmembrane domains of PEDV M protein. It should be very interesting to address this question in the future by the expression of M in other eukaryotic vector systems such as recombinant vaccinia or herpes viruses."

20,2117460,"The high prevalence of AdV (24?7%) and hBoV (18?7%) coinfections could have been caused by asymptomatic persistence or prolonged nasopharyngeal shedding. Certainly AdV shedding in faeces can go on for many months following acute infection, [23] but while it is unknown whether this also occurs in the nasopharynx, no other study has found such high AdV detection rates. [11, 12, 13] Another possible explanation is that these findings may reflect living conditions, with AdV being a well-described cause of epidemic respiratory disease in crowded susceptible populations such as military trainees. [24] High rates of hBoV have been described [10, 25] with asymptomatic persistence in the upper airways for up to 2 months following an acute infection.

22,1620356,"In this study, we were able to demonstrate the distribution and expression of the S1 protein in the vaccinated group but not in the control groups (Ad-CMV and PBS) by detection of the truncated protein-encoding segment in kidney and lung tissues following vaccination using conventional PCR and IHC. These findings support the ability of this vaccine candidate to distribute effectively within host tissues and express the target protein. It has been established that DPP4 is expressed on multiple cell types in the human body including cells in the kidneys and lungs [24] . However, the N glycoprotein, but not the S glycoprotein, of MERS was the target of investigation of MERS-CoV localization using IHC [38] . The N glycoprotein was clearly present in lung tissues following MERS exposure. In fact, the current study can be considered pioneering given the use of the S1 glycoprotein to express viral distribution in tissues. Therefore, the expression of S1 protein in kidney tissues and not in lung might be used to explain previous in vitro experiments, which found a cytopathic effect of the MERS-CoV infection inside primary human kidney cells but not in primary human bronchial epithelial cells [39] . In a recent study, the adenoviral vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein but not the adenoviral vector with MERS in a hDPP4 mice experiment after intramuscular or intranasal injection [21] . This supporting our finding that this construct was able to reach the lung tissues, but the S1 protein was not expressed in lung tissues. However, S1 gene detection in lung tissues by conventional PCR and not by IHC indicates further investigation is necessary regarding the level and intensity of S1 expression in this tissue. Additional studies are also needed to explore S1 protein expression in other tissues such as the liver and intestine given the expression of DPP4 in these tissues [40] ."

Although it is recognized this technique was not yet employed on any COVID-Risk of infection with COVID-19 increases with exposure time. 4 . Although risk of COVID-19 cannot be eradicated during a thoracic operation, it can be diminished. The method Dr. Seco and colleagues advocate for is only safely filtering when the chest is completely contained by ports and instruments. This does not aid during times of port insertion, specimen retrieval, and thoracostomy tube placement where exposure still exists. With the expansion of the isolated contralateral chest -causing movement of the mediastinum -there is likely a small but present air volume influx and egress on the operative side. Therefore, were a patient to be COVID-19 positive, there is still sufficient time for exposure to those present in the operating room even with insufflation and desufflation filters in place. Additionally, port-based chest operations are not always routine for thoracic surgeons which limits this technique's broad applicability. In the included video, no n95 particulate respirator masks were visibly utilized and this addition would likely further decrease viral exposure during thoracic surgery by providing protection during periods of imperfect circuit containment. 5 Although the technique demonstrates clear potential benefit, the obvious next step in this technique is the inclusion of real-world data demonstrating its efficacy."
25,346405,"The potential of SARS-CoV transmission through the blood supply is unknown, whereas close contact with symptomatic patients is the main route of transmission Tong & Liang, 2004) . SARS-CoV, however, has been detected in blood of infected individuals (Grant et al., 2003; Yam et al., 2003) . The current NAT assays have, however, important limitations because they detect the SARS-CoV in only 75% of infected individuals during the first week of symptoms Drosten et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2004) . False-negative NAT results can occur due to PCR inhibitors or faulty RNA extraction. False-positive NAT results have also been reported with the consequence of triggering alarm bells worldwide (Yu, 2004) . Real-time PCR assays have been modified in order to improve specificity and sensitivity (Lau et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2004) . The window period for detection of SARS-CoV in blood remains undefined; in this regard, it has been postulated that the time course of SARS-CoV viremia may be relatively short, in that the viral load is too low to be detected 12-14 days after the onset of symptoms Ng et al., 2004) . In addition, the prevalence of individuals infected with the SARS-CoV in high-risk areas remains unknown. A recent report supports the existence of sub clinical or nonpneumonic SARS-CoV infections (Woo et al., 2004) . Nonpneumonic SARS-CoV infection was present in healthy blood donors during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong (Woo et al., 2004) , although the levels of SARS-CoV viremia were not reported. Significant correspondence, however, was generated by respondents casting doubt on Woo's findings (Yip et al., 2004; Theron, 2004; Young, 2004; Zhou, 2004) . Nevertheless, pathogen inactivation is a proactive approach to blood safety for pre-emptively dealing with new emerging agents before they affect the safety of the blood supply without necessarily knowing the levels of infectious particles in the blood stream. The INTERCEPT Blood System utilizing amotosalen and UV-A light has been shown to inactivate bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and leucocytes (Lin et al., 1997; VanVoorhis et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2004) . †The '<' sign indicates that no infectious virus was detected in the volume assayed. ‡The '>' sign indicates inactivation to below the limit of detection."

Using the current much larger dataset of HRV-C sequences and a shorter fragment (positions 616-1004, based on typical coordinates of sequences available in GenBank), pairwise pdistance distributions were plotted, along with those for species A and B (Fig. 6) . Detailed inspection of distributions of pairwise distances showed possible assignment thresholds of 10.5, 9.5 and 10.5 % for HRV-A, -B and -C, respectively, based on minimum values. The shorter length and greater sequence conservation than VP1 resulted in less-well-defined thresholds and a greater proportion of pairwise comparisons close to the assignment threshold, which may cause problems with type identification."
28,564072,"Influenza A viruses are members of the family Orthomyxoviridae, which comprises enveloped viruses with segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes (Wright et al. 2007 ). Based on the antigenicity of the two surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), influenza A viruses are currently divided into 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes, designated as H1-H16 and N1-N9. Over the past century, only viruses of the H1N1, H2N2, H3N2 and H1N2 subtypes have circulated in humans (Wright et al. 2007) . Highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype viruses cause severe disease in humans, characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction and high mortality rate of more than 50% (Neumann et al. 2010) . Since 2003, they have spread across large parts of the globe and continued to cause sporadic human infections. Although HPAI H5N1 viruses fortunately have not acquired the ability for efficient infection in and transmission between humans, statistical evidence of human-to-human transmission has been obtained from epidemiological studies (Yang et al. 2007) , suggesting the potential to acquire the ability of sustained human-to-human transmission. To prepare for the worst (namely, the occurrence of an influenza pandemic by this lethal virus), it is essential to evaluate the infectivity and pathogenicity of HPAI H5N1 virus."
29,1212224,"The most recent evidence revealed that the one-third genome of SARS-CoV-2 is encoded by four different types of viral proteins, including envelope (E), spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (Sarma et al. 2020 ). The newly structural detailed studies on COVID-19 revealed that the nucleocapsid proteins (N) are located in the coronavirus genome, which considers as one of the most abundant proteins due to their involvement in virus replication, transcription as well as in RNA synthesis. The nucleocapsid proteins (N) formed the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, which known as an important factor during viral assembly. The nucleocapsid proteins of coronavirus systematized into two terminal domains, including the C-terminal domain (CTD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) during RNA binding. The emerging evidence suggested that the NTD is responsible for RNA genome binding of protein-protein interaction formation and folded into monomeric conformation (Nguyen et al. 2019; ."
30,920338,"Traditional Chinese medicines therapy Traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) include different types of natural products, with each relating to a group of diseases [143] . TCMs that have shown activity against viral infections, specifically lung infections, could be potential therapies for relieving the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as proposed in the literature by different research groups [43, 139, 144] . It worth mentioning herein that TCMs have been used in the control of several epidemics and pandemic diseases over thousands of years, which shows their effectiveness [143, 145, 146] . Moreover, TCMs were included in the guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China [145] . Results have shown that the symptoms of COVID-19 were shortened in 60,107 confirmed cases. However, more clinical studies are needed that require time. Jian-Ping et al. have done a study based on historical records on the prevention and treatment of infections using TCM, TCM prevention programs issued by Chinese health authorities and databases, and preliminary literature results about using TCM in other respiratory viral infections [147] . Based on the results, Jian-Ping et al. have confirmed the use of TCM as a preventive therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another trial study that is under process is also using TCM. In this study, interventional subjects will receive triple therapy includes oxidative therapy, an antiviral and TCM [143] . Zhang et al. have concluded that TCMs could contain direct constituents for the treatment of COVID-19 [139] . In this study, it has been identified as different TCMs that have been previously used in treating respiratory viral infections by an in silico screening."

32,602869,"Largely on the basis of Garrodian thinking, Childs, in 1999, 37 developed what he called ""a logic of medicine,"" defining logic as a statement of the formal principles underlying a branch of knowledge. From these analyses came a vision of individualized medicine-a brand of medicine designed to match the uniqueness of the individual and encompassing all disease, including common disease. Despite its title Mendelian Inheritance in Man, there are reasons why identifiable genetic factors in all disease including those that are not strictly Mendelian should be included in OMIM (see below). These are the common disorders previously labeled ""multifactorial"" and now usually termed ""complex traits"" (or disorders). The more we know about classic Mendelian disorders, the more we realize that these are also complex; see the example of glycerol kinase deficiency (MIM #307030). 38 Conversely, Mendelian subtypes of common complex disorders have come to light."
33,2322296,"Involvement of the secretory route in the biogenesis of poliovirus replication complexes was suggested by the finding that brefeldin A, which inhibits the transport of secretory proteins from the ER to the Golgi complex, also inhibits poliovirus replication both in vivo and in vitro (Racaniello 2001) . The importance of ER as the primary source for poliovirus replication complexes was confirmed recently by experiments in which COPII coat components were shown to colocalize with poliovirus nonstructural proteins on budding vesicles upon their exit from ER. Resident ER proteins were excluded from the released vesicles, which were not destined to the Golgi complex, but accumulated in the cytoplasm (Rust et al. 2001 ). These results are in conformity with previous findings, which showed that poliovirus infection inhibits the transport of secretory and plasma membrane proteins (Doedens and Kirkegaard 1995) . Thus it seems that in poliovirus-infected cells a continuous proliferation and loss of ER membranes takes place. This process does not supply the Golgi complex with its normal lipids. The sensitivity of poliovirus replication to lipid synthesis inhibitors such as cerulenin could be explained by this scenario (Racaniello 2001; . Overexpression of viral or cellular ER-associated proteins also inhibits poliovirus replication, possibly by competing for the capacity of ER to generate new membrane material (Egger et al. 2000) ."
34,135295,"Besides the serious agriculture losses [30] , the effectiveness of LPMs needs further evaluation. One field study demonstrated that during the closure, H7N9 viral RNA detection and isolation rates in retail markets decreased by 79 and 92%, respectively. However, viable H7N9 virus could be cultured from wastewater samples collected up to 2 days after the market closure began [31] . Overall, LPMs reopen and temporary interventions cannot completely halt A (H7N9) virus persistence and dissemination. In order to balance the interests of agriculture economics [32] and public health, government encourages residence purchase chilled chicken instead of live poultry. Chilled chickens are slaughtered and packaged chicken stored at between 0°C and 4°C after going through a chilling process and has a shelf-life of 5-7 days, which can highly reduce the risk of virus transmission from live poultry to human [23] . Since the outbreaks of H7N9, many cities that reported the cases have launched a pilot program (named ""Centralized Slaughtering, Cold Chain Delivery, Chilled Poultry Supply"") in designated areas, such as 2013 in Shanghai, 2014 in Guangzhou and Shenzhen [11] . Furthermore, the long-lasting circulation of the H7N9 virus in market poultry has often preceded the emergence of H7N9 outbreaks [14] . Based on the above considerations, on 1st June 2016, Shenzhen was the first city in China implemented the LPMs all closure in the whole city and sold chilled poultry instead of live poultry in urban and suburb areas. This policy of live poultry ban in the whole city can prevent any type of avian influenza not only H7N9. It is an optimal measure with long-term effectiveness to block the avian infected virus transmit to human, our results proved that as well."
35,355612,"There are variable results related to the risk perception of swine influenza in different studies [20] [21] [22] . In their study Rubin et al found that 21% of their study which was conducted just at the beginning of the pandemic, population had high anxiety about swine influenza [20] . Barr et al found that 45.5% of their study population was very or extremely concerned that they or their family would have been affected, although at the time of this study avian influenza pandemic was expected [21] . Lau et al found that 10% of the participants considered themselves to have high or very high chance of contracting influenza A/H1N1 in the prepandemic period [22] . It is difficult to compare the results, since these studies have been conducted before or at the very beginning of the pandemic, also in diffrent countries and their cohort was general public. Risk perception and compliance with preventive measures may have changed during the pandemic period. In a very recent study conducted during the peak period of the pandemic in Australia, Van et al showed that perception of susceptibility of university students and staff in the University of New South Wales significantly decreased with the decline of laboratory confirmed cases [23] . In their study, whilst 60.4% believed that it was serious, 64.2% reported either""no anxiety"" or ""disinterest"" at the beginning of the study and towards the end of the survey period and the end of the winter, the percentage reporting ""no anxiety"" increased and the proportion of participants who believed pandemic was serious decreased. It was not possible to evaluate any change related with pandemic period in attitudes with this study. We expected higher self-risk perception since the study was conducted at the peak point of the outbreak. But, most of the students believed that healthy people do not get swine influenza very easily and if they had taken enough precautions they would not be infected even they hadn't been vaccinated which might have effected their risk perceptions."
36,2034660,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) have been recognized as emerging pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality, leading to major economic losses in both humans and animals [1] . They are currently classified into four genera, the Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronavirus, identified in diverse animal species including humans [2] . With its origin still unknown, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a recently emerged deltacoronavirus in swine. It particularly targets neonatal piglets, causing acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . In 2012, PDCoV was first identified in swine herds in Hong Kong and was subsequently reported as an enteric pathogen causing diarrhea in the United States in 2014 [2, 3, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Shortly thereafter, PDCoV has been reported in South Korea, mainland China and Thailand [4, 12, 13] . Currently, PDCoV, together with other enteric viruses including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), rotavirus (RV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), is causing enormous economic losses in the swine industry worldwide [9, 14] ."

38,1529683,"Since November, 2002, an infectious agent has caused outbreaks of an atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province, southern China. 1 The illness usually began with high fever and mild respiratory symptoms, but rapidly progressed to pneumonia within a few days. 2 At the end of February, 2003, the disease had spread to neighbouring regions and countries. 3, 4 The disease was severe, transmissible from person to person, and seemed to cause clusters of disease in health-care workers. It was named severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and WHO issued a global alert about the disease on March 13, 2003. 5,6 SARS outbreaks occurred in South-East Asia, North America, and Europe, and gave rise to the first pandemic of the 21st century."
39,923775,"The World Health Organization (WHO) used for the first time the term novel coronavirus in reference to a coronavirus that affected the lower respiratory tract of patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, China on December 29, 2019. WHO has stated that the official name for the novel coronavirus is Covid-19, coronavirus disease 2019, while the reference name for the virus is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1] . WHO considers essential for the fight against the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to increase the scientific knowledge about the disease and to develop and test new diagnostic methods for the virus, in order to carry out screenings in the population. In fact, all countries that have made extensive use of diagnostic tests for the entire population, regardless of the presence of symptoms, have achieved a drastic drop in infection and in the spread of infection. To date, the only tool officially recognized by the Italian Ministry of Health for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is real time RT-PCR method on samples obtained by bronchoscopy, blood or feces . This diagnostic method has limitations related to the cost of reagents and the time required for the complete analysis along with an unacceptably large number of false negatives [2] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop accurate, rapid and inexpensive methods to be combined with epidemiological, radiological [4, 5] and clinical data [6] in order to enhance RT-PCR potential to identify infected as well as asymptomatic carriers to prevent virus transmission and assure timely treatment [3] ."
40,1091830,"A primary barrier used to protect health care workers and the general public from airborne infections is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved filtering facepiece respirator (FFR). (Note that although many types of FFRs are available, this report focuses on six models of N95 FFRs. All references to FFRs in this manuscript specify N95 FFRs). The FFR is rated to capture ≥95% of airborne 300-nm particles and has been proven to remove infectious microorganisms from the airstream. (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) The modes for human-to-human transmission of influenza are actively debated, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) but data have been reported that support aerosol transmission. (11, 15) This information led the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to recommend that workers wear a properly fitted NIOSHapproved FFR during a pandemic influenza outbreak. (17, 18) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also demonstrated their support of FFRs by issuing an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA), which approves release of FFRs from the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) for use by the general public. (19) The CDC estimated that during a pandemic lasting 42 days, more than 90 million FFRs would be required for health care workers alone. (20) These projections indicate that a shortage of FFRs is likely to occur, which would leave health care workers exposed and might aggravate the severity of the pandemic. A possible solution for alleviating an FFR shortage is to decontaminate and reuse the FFRs, (20) and Cal/OSHA has set a relevant precedent by issuing guidelines for extended use and re-donning as conservation measures recommended by the California Department of Public Health. (21) FFRs are labeled as ""single-use"" devices and have not been approved for reuse. Consequently, very few data are available that describe how FFRs behave following treatment with decontamination agents. Many properties must be studied before FFR decontamination and reuse would be allowed: filtration efficiency, pressure drop, fit, residual chemicals, and overall durability are key questions that must be addressed. NIOSH has reported initial studies that suggest that some technologies can be used to decontaminate FFRs without affecting performance. (22) However, other technologies tested-for example, autoclaving-rendered the FFRs unusable. (22) These tests were performed on a limited number of FFR models, and more research is needed on a larger number of FFRs to properly evaluate decontamination technologies."
41,937575,"Cyclosporine, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and its derivatives has been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV replication in vitro (de Wilde et al., 2013) . It has been demonstrated that CsA could restore type I IFN expression upon hepatitis C or rotavirus virus infection (Liu et al., 2011; Shen et al., 2013) . Combined use of CsA and type I IFN was shown to inhibit hepatitis C virus replication and trigger greater virological response than IFN treatment alone (Henry et al., 2006; Inoue et al., 2003) . As CsA has known immune suppressive function, non-immunosuppressive cyclophilin inhibitors have been tried in combination with ribavirin for MERS-CoV infection. Though these have an in vitro effect on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, this did not translate into a benefit in a mouse model (de Wilde et al., 2017) . Here, we report the individual and combined effects of CsA and IFN-α1 on inhibiting MERS-CoV replication in an in vitro and human lung and bronchus ex vivo explant culture model. We found the combined use of CsA and IFN-α1 had inhibitory effects on MERS-CoV infection and replication, as well as on the induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISG), which sheds light on the potential use of this combination in curing MERS-CoV infection."
42,1066922,"In a lot of cardiology out-patient clinics, obvious changes include moving to distance follow-up instead of a clinic visit and also extending the length of follow-up phone calls, since many patients want to talk about COVID-19 and what it means to them. In some hospitals, the pacemaker control period is extended from bi-or trimonthly to yearly, most angiograms and electrophysiology procedures are cancelled. ICDs are monitored using telemonitoring systems, preventing patients from coming to hospital after receiving a shock therapy and reassuring them by telephone. It is amazing how quickly telecare and distance monitoring have become almost 'the new normal' and how flexible patient and healthcare professionals are in adopting these practices. 1 However, specific challenges of distance follow-up have also become painfully clear and need creative solutions. 2 For example, it is more difficult to estimate whether a newly referred patient or his or her family can recognise signs and symptoms, such as leg oedema in heart failure patients, or whether they are able to decide if it is necessary to come to the hospital. In addition, in patients with visual or auditory impairments, it can be difficult to change medication by phone, especially when a patient does not have email or cannot read very well. For patients who are very lonely and feel socially isolated, and/or elderly patients, extra telephone contact with the clinic can be very important to ask questions and help to solve problems."

However, acute HBoV1 infection, diagnosed by a high virus load in respiratory samples, viremia, detection of HBoV1-specific IgM, or an increase in the levels of HBoV1-specific IgG antibodies, and detection of HBoV1 mRNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates, results in respiratory illness (Allander et al., 2007; Christensen et al., 2010 Christensen et al., , 2013 Deng et al., 2012; Don et al., 2010; Kantola et al., 2008; Nascimento-Carvalho et al., 2012; Soderlund-Venermo et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010) .

The pattern of this distribution, particularly the long righthand tail, was similar to the distribution observed in similar studies in China [10] and the UK [11, 26] -studies which also were designed to enable participants to report large numbers of contacts easily by reporting groups of similar contacts. We also found distribution consistency between waves for both total contact duration and number of locations (figure 2b,c). Chi-squared tests showed no significant difference in the distributions between waves of the number of contacts or the number of locations reported; however, distributions of duration were different between waves ( p , 0.001). Stratified by study wave, the number of contacts made by age groups of participants also showed a similar pattern (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). Across all four waves of study, the mean average daily number of contacts reported was 12.5, recorded in an average of 2.9 different locations, while the mean duration of contact events was 9.1 h per day."

Some ORFs may also be unconventionally translated from a single mRNA. As these uncommon translation mechanisms are not very Whereas the ORFs between the structural protein genes are very heterogeneous among the different coronaviruses and not essential for viral replication, recent studies suggested that deletion of non-essential ORFs may result in a reduced virulence [32] . In agreement with this, some of these non-essential ORFs of the new SARS-CoV genome may be responsible for the high SARS-CoV virulence."

50,2714938,"Since June 2009, infection with influenza A (H1N1) virus has reached pandemic proportions. A minority of patients with H1N1 virus infection (0.3-13 %) needed hospitalization, and 10-30 % of these developed rapidly progressive pneumonia. The ensuing profound inflammatory response caused the most severe form of acute lung injury, called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), either isolated or as part of a multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) [1] . ARDS due to this infection was associated with a high mortality rate (14-41 %) [1, 2] . Controversy exists regarding use of anti-inflammatory agents such as corticosteroids (CS) for ARDS. While an initial meta-analysis concluded that a definitive role of CS in ARDS was not established, a more recent one reported improved mortality as well as length of stay and less organ dysfunction with early, low-to moderate-dose CS in some subgroups of ARDS patients [3, 4] ."
51,1400674,"To rapidly measure the degree of genetic relatedness among the HAdV-7 isolates from the outbreak and non-recruit cases, WGS was performed on ten HAdV-7 isolates including those from the index cases. Genome sequences were deposited in the GenBank database (accession nos. KJ019879-KJ019888). By aligning the sequenced genomes and using 0901 HZ as a reference genome (accession no. JF800905), the nine outbreak isolates, including those from the index cases (accession nos. KJ019879, KJ019880 and KJ019885), were 100% identical. Phylogenetic analysis of the WGS showed that the outbreak isolates formed an independent sublineage among the HAdV-7 strains (Fig. 3A) . Comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that the outbreak isolates had genomes nearly identical with an isolate CDC228 (accession no. KJ019884) identified from a local patient, as well as other five strains (accession nos. JF800905, KC440171, JX625134, KF268314 and KF268316) circulating in China 6, 18, 19 . Further phylogenetic analysis of the individual whole genes revealed that the outbreak isolates clustered with the local isolate CDC228 as well as the above five strains, and shared 100% similarities in the hexon and fiber genes (Fig. 3B,C) . However, the outbreak strains formed a separate subclade in the phylogenetic trees based on the penton, DNA polymerase and VA RNA genes (Figs 3D and 4A,C). Genome comparisons revealed that the outbreak isolates had only minor differences in the penton and DNA polymerase genes with CDC228 and the above reference strains (Table 3 , Figs 3D and 4A), but a distinct point mutation was observed among them when compared with other HAdV-7 strains, resulting in the replacement of Leu381 with Ile (Table 3 and Fig. 4B ). Additionally, all of the outbreak isolates showed an obvious difference with other HAdV-7 strains in the VA RNA genes (Fig. 4C) , with a unique deletion of 12 base pair in the VA RNA II region (Table 3 and Fig. 4D ). The universality of this unique deletion and the distinct point mutation were verified among an additional 46 HAdV-7 outbreak strains by PCR and DNA sequencing (data not shown)."
52,504275,"HRVs have remarkable genetic and antigenic variability, 102 known serotypes of HRV-A and B, and new types of HRV-C are being discovered continually. It is known that recombination events in the HRV genome have increased the diversity of each virus in the family Picornaviridae [20, 21, 22, 23] . In earlier studies, Lee et al. (2007) analyzed the 5′NCR of 103 HRVs from Wisconsin and confirmed nine novel field strains [13, 25] . In 2009, Huang et al. referred to these results and studied recombinant HRV-C among 66 HRVs from cases of ARI. In that study, 14 of 34 strains of HRV-C were found to be related closely to HRV-A by analysis of the 5′ NCR sequences, and these strains of HRV-C were designated as ""HRV Ca"". The authors suggested that this strain had arisen from interspecies recombination, and that the Cc subspecies containing the HRV-C 5′NCR and VP4/VP2 sequences had not experienced a recombination event [10, 25] . Palmenberg et al. identified intraspecies recombination of the HRV-A strain in three HRV-A reference viruses and interspecies recombination events in HRV-C viruses by phylogenetic and recombinant detection analysis [8, 10, 24, 25] . In the present study, intraspecies recombination events of HRV-A and interspecies recombination events of HRV-C were also detected using similar methods. Surprisingly, we also detected three cases (2.8%) of interspecies recombination in HRV-A and four cases (3.8%) of intraspecies recombination in HRV-C viruses. The incidence of recombination events was found to be similarly distributed in both HRV-C (11/48 cases) and HRV-A (8/52 cases) strains (P>0.05) by testing for any difference between the two proportions [39] . We also confirmed that interspecies recombination events had occurred in 14 reference strains of HRV-C reference strains: QPM, QCE, NAT001, NY-074, C 24, C 25, C 26, N36, N46, C-43 p1154, CL170085, LZ269, LZY79 and LZY101. Interestingly, KA08-3539 and KA08-4189 have the same nucleotides in the 5′NCR regions which clustered with the C isolate LZ508, but have the different VP4/VP2 sequences. Thus, KA08-3539 (interspecies recombination in HRV-A) and KA08-4189 (intraspecies recombination in HRV-C) were related to HRV-A 42 and to the C isolate LZY101, respectively. KA08-4374 (interspecies recombination in HRV-A) and KA09-756 (intraspecies recombination in HRV-C) also had the same 5′ NCR and differences in the VP4/VP2 sequences. We assume that recombination events in the 5′NCR between VP4 and VP2 could have led to this diversity of HRVs."
53,2970513,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel human coronavirus (CoV), has established itself as a fatal human respiratory disease [1, 2, 3, 4] . SARS-CoV is transmitted through virus-laden droplets, and likely also via either the aerosol or fecaloral routes, with the lungs as its main pathological target. While the exact mechanism of SARS pathogenesis remains unknown, pathological examination of lung biopsies and autopsy specimens from SARS patients revealed ''diffuse alveolar damage'' of varying stages and severities, with extensive disruption of epithelial cells and accumulation of reactive macrophages (MWs), accompanied by the presence of hemophagocytic syndrome in patients who succumbed to the disease [5, 6, 7, 8] . Strikingly, pulmonary manifestations of SARS patients usually occurred after the clearance of viremia and often in the absence of other opportunistic infections. Taken together, these observations have led to the hypothesis that SARS pathogenesis might stem from ill-regulated and often excessive inflammatory responses within the lungs [5] . The likelihood of SARS being an immune-mediated disease was further supported by reports, within the circulation and the lungs of patients affected by SARS, of highly elevated expressions of various inflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL)-1, -6, -8; CXCL-10/Interferon-inducible Protein (IP)-10; CCL2/Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein (MCP)-1; CCL5/Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted (RANTES); and CXCL9/Monokine Induced by interferon-Gamma (MIG) [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14] . Such an exacerbated cytokine response was subsequently demonstrated in experimentally infected mice, especially those transgenically expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) viral receptor [15, 16, 17] ."
54,1976289,"Recombination between IBVs and its role in emergence of new IBV variants has been reported previously [2, 15, 17, 21] and may occur at multiple sites [15, 17] , although crossover events occur more frequently at the 3 0 end of the S gene [5, 15, 21] , as seen in this study. However, it is particularly notable here because of the very significant phylogenic distance between the novel and classical Australian strains of IBV. Indeed, the novel strains of IBV are more distinct from the classical strains than is turkey coronavirus, and they lack several of the smaller nonstructural genes found in classical strains. In conclusion, this study showed that the recombination was involved in the emergence of the new variant of IBV in Australia and that a rapid and reliable technique is needed to determine whether the novel IBVs are still circulating in poultry farms. It would be appropriate to sequence and analyse the polymerase genes of classical, novel and new variant strains of IBV to obtain further information about the relationships between the different Australian IBVs."
55,643665,"[1] that a new virus, tentatively named ""human metapneumovirus,"" is associated with acute respiratory disease. In addition, our data demonstrate that this virus is present in North America and likely worldwide. Our findings are also consistent with the aforementioned findings [1] : we identified 2 major groups or lineages and sequence diversity within these 2 major groups. Human RSV, a paramyxovirus in the same taxonomic subfamily, has been classified into 2 major groups, A and B. Concurrent circulation of both human RSV groups and variants has been identified [8] . One could speculate that HMPV might also follow these trends. We found some HMPV isolates that, despite close genetic relatedness, did not originate from a single outbreak but were from discrete and unrelated cases of respiratory illness, as also occurs with human RSV. Further sequencing studies that examine more isolates and different HMPV genes, including the surface glycoprotein G gene, should be conducted to confirm and refine these observations. We detected virus in isolates from children with acute respiratory tract infection, as described in the first report of HMPV [1] . We also detected virus in isolates from adults with acute respiratory tract infection. If the serologic studies from The Netherlands [1] are indicative of the epidemiologic features of infection in Canada (i.e., most children are infected by age 5 years), then HMPV likely can reinfect an individual later in life, possibly repeatedly, as does human RSV."
56,1027941,"The Mass-like sequences in the ck/CH/LJL/111054 genome showed high genetic similarities and were closely related to a Mass H120 vaccine, compared to that of strain M41, implicating a possible H120-related vaccine origin. Mass-type vaccines are very commonly used in chicken flocks in China and can persist in the field for long periods. Until now, no Conn-like viruses have been found in chicken flocks in China, however, Mass-Conn bivalent vaccines is used extensively throughout China, although it is not government approved. Due to the unavailability of the sequence of Conn-type vaccine strains so far, we cannot compare the sequences in the genome of isolate ck/CH/LJL/111054 with those of a Conntype vaccine strain."

Among these, four (human coronaviruses 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) typically infect only the upper respiratory tract and cause relatively minor symptoms 2 . However, there are three coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2) that can replicate in the lower respiratory tract and cause pneumonia, which can be fatal. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the betacoronavirus genus. Its closest relative among human coronaviruses is SARS-CoV, with 79% genetic similarity 3 .

In Italy, a notable decrease in solid organ transplantation and procurement has already been observed in the first four weeks of the pandemic [10] . Currently, decisions on prioritizing certain procedures-including KT-are based on expert opinions rather than on evidence, contributing to different spread-dependent restrictions between regions [7] . In addition, it is unclear which immunosuppressive induction regimen can be administered safely. Especially, the administration of thymoglobulins causing long-lasting lymphopenia has been discussed critically, as a low lymphocyte count has been negatively associated with the disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [1, 11, 12] . Even planned immunosuppression in living donation has been questioned [1] . The American Society of Transplantation and the European Association of Urology currently recommend to defer non-urgent KTs with living donors, but to perform urgent KTs-depending on the local situation [13, 14] .

59,2575563,"The incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 7 to 21 days [34, 58] . The clinical disease begins as a flu-like illness characterized by fever, general weakness, and malaise, which may be accompanied by cough, sore throat, and severe headache. Gastrointestinal manifestations such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are also common ( Table 2 ). The differential diagnosis of Lassa fever based on the presenting symptoms can be problematic due to the many other acute undifferentiated febrile illnesses circulating in West Africa [58, 59] . Although, hemorrhagic manifestations are not an important feature of Lassa fever, perturbation of vascular function is likely to be central to Lassa fever-associated pathobiology, since the signs of increased vascular permeability, such as facial edema and pleural and pericardial effusions, indicate a poor prognosis for the disease outcome. Recovery from Lassa fever generally begins within 8 to 10 days of disease onset. In severe cases, the condition of the patient deteriorates rapidly between the 6th and 10th day of illness with severe pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress, clinical signs of encephalopathy, sometimes with coma and seizures, and terminal shock. Bleeding from mucosal surfaces is often observed; however, it is usually not of a magnitude to produce shock by itself [58] . Sensorineural deafness is commonly observed in patients in the late stages of disease or in early convalescence in survivors [60] ."

Given that the asymptomatic persons are potential sources of COVID-19 infection [3] , we report a familial cluster case of five patients infected with COVID-19 from an asymptomatic confirmed case in Beijing. We obtained the data of patients, which included demographic, epidemiological, and clinical features; chest radiography; laboratory test; and outcomes. Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was detected in the first hospital admission and verified by the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). An asymptomatic case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection case who was afebrile and well. We enrolled the family that had five patients in total with COVID-19 infection who were transferred by the Beijing Emergency Medical Service (EMS) from January 24 to 27, 2020, to the designated hospitals for special treatment.

For these kittens, it has been recommended that vaccination be withheld for 3 weeks after the serum has been administered. 39 Passive immunization may be useful when cats are introduced into a shelter situation where a known problem exists. Repeated treatment with serum should be avoided because hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Prevention of feline panleukopenia should also include proper disinfection with disinfectants that are effective against parvoviruses, such as bleach, accelerated hydrogen peroxide, or potassium peroxymonosulfate (see Chapter 11) and, in shelter situations, isolation or removal of cats that develop gastrointestinal illness, and separate housing for healthy kittens."

63,3035763,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) act as cross-species viruses and have the potential to spread rapidly into new host species and cause epidemic diseases. Despite the severe public health threat of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), there are currently no drugs available for their treatment; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are urgently needed. To search for effective inhibitory agents, we performed high-throughput screening (HTS) of a 2,000-compound library of approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds using the established genetically engineered human CoV OC43 (HCoV-OC43) strain expressing Renilla luciferase (rOC43-ns2Del-Rluc) and validated the inhibitors using multiple genetically distinct CoVs in vitro. We screened 56 hits from the HTS data and validated 36 compounds in vitro using wild-type HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, we identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. Additionally, we found that emetine blocked MERS-CoV entry according to pseudovirus entry assays and that lycorine protected BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This represents the first demonstration of in vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging to monitor the effect of lycorine on the spread and distribution of HCoV-OC43 in a mouse model. These results offer critical information supporting the development of an effective therapeutic strategy against CoV infection. IMPORTANCE Currently, there is no approved therapy to treat coronavirus infection; therefore, broad-spectrum inhibitors of emerging and endemic CoVs are needed. Based on our high-throughput screening assay using a compound library, we identified seven compounds with broad-spectrum efficacy against the replication of four CoVs in vitro. Additionally, one compound (lycorine) was found to protect BALB/c mice against HCoV-OC43-induced lethality by decreasing viral load in the central nervous system. This inhibitor might offer promising therapeutic possibilities for combatting novel CoV infections in the future."

There has been increase in the internet access and usage among dental professionals to receive information about infection control (11) . Moreover, now a day's internet is widely available and utilized to gain knowledge on evolving disease by many health care professionals including DHPs (12) . Educational materials posted on the website of the ministry of health during the outbreak of MERS CoV could be one of the major sources of knowledge among health professionals including DHPs. Moreover, individualized text messages sent by the relevant professional agencies to their registered health professionals could be the source of this knowledge. In addition, seminar, symposium and research articles could be the source of knowledge about isolation precautions among dental health professionals during the MERS outbreak (4). All above mentioned factors could have played role in increasing knowledge of isolation precautions among DHPs.

68,2021148,"Prolonged shedding of the virus was noted from the respiratory tract of the patient. This finding is consistent with data regarding the SARS coronavirus. In a report dealing with patients affected by SARS, prolonged shedding of the virus was noted in stool (up to 126 days) and respiratory specimens (up to 52 days) [16] . Data regarding the length of MERS-CoV excretion from different body sites are scarce [17] . Excretion of the virus probably depends on the amplitude of replication in different body sites, the underlying immune status and co-morbidities, and appropriate antiviral therapy. The non-detectable viral RNA in serum by Day 3 after initiation of the antiviral treatment could be explained either by viral clearance in an otherwise immunocompetent person or by effectiveness of the instituted antiviral regimen. Literature on appropriate antiviral intervention for MERS-CoV is very limited and currently no evidence-based therapy exists. The regimen chosen was based on the best available literature as well as evidence from animal and patient data that have been described elsewhere [2] [3] [4] . The role of interferon therapy for MERS-CoV infection needs to be further elucidated. An attenuated interferon-␤ (IFN-␤) response has been described as a result of MERS-CoV infection [18] and extensive use of interferon-based regimens alone or in combination with ribavirin has been described for SARS [4] . However, interferons appear to have a better antiviral effect on MERS-CoV compared with SARS-CoV in in vitro experiments [19] . In vitro, IFN-␤ appears to exhibit the best anti-MERS-CoV effect [20] . Interferon activity has been enhanced by the addition of ribavirin in in vitro experiments [21] . Furthermore, this combination has shown promising clinical and radiological effects in Rhesus macaques experimentally infected with MERS-CoV [12] . Thus, the clinical team elected to use this combination despite the fact that a prestigious public health agency ranks ribavirin use as not supported by high-quality evidence [5] . In a more recent update published by the same public health agency, the use of interferons and lopinavir is ranked under the recommendation of benefit is likely to exceed risk, whereas the combination of interferon and ribavirin is ranked as data are inadequate for assessment [22] . The frequent side effects of ribavirin limit its use in combination regimens for actual MERS-CoV-infected patients, as was the experience with the current patient where liver toxicity, although not definitively associated, was mainly attributed to this medication. The renal function deterioration of the patient described here was considered multifactorial and probably also a complication of the virus infection [23] . The possibility that drug toxicity might have contributed in the renal dysfunction could not be excluded, however. No drug levels were measured since the patient was under continuous renal replacement therapy at that time and drug levels would be unreliable. In the actual clinical human setting, the combination of ribavirin and interferon has been tried, with no successful outcome reported among any of the MERS-CoV-infected recipients [3] . Nevertheless, the group studied consisted of severely ill patients who received this combination quite late in the course of their disease [3] . Lastly, we added the protease inhibitors lopinavir/ritonavir based on experience accumulated from the SARS epidemic where the addition of this agent to ribavirin improved the outcome of infection [24] ."

We did not observe a definitive pattern of association between CRP and ICU admission -patient 3 had a CRP upon ICU admission that was lower than that of patient 1 upon initial hospitalization. In contrast, as these patients' clinical conditions turned critical, min1 seemed to be the first CWA parameter to rise, with all three patients exhibiting raised min1 upon ICU admission. This raises the exciting possibility that high min1 may be a useful biomarker to predict severity in COVID-19 infected patients, but further study is needed."
70,1454063,"One challenge to rapid and accurate diagnosis is the continual evolution of influenza viruses. 2 The eight RNA gene segments of influenza A viruses mutate at different rates. 3 Specifically, the HA and NA genes, on which diagnostics depend, have high mutation rates compared to the other genes. This rapid evolution in the H5N1 viruses isolated since 1997 has resulted in the emergence of genetically and antigenically distinct lineages (http://www.WHOweblink. org). The circulating H5N1 viruses can currently be grouped into many different clades with four clades including viruses that have infected humans in the following countries: 4 • A second major challenge to global diagnostic capability is the availability of healthcare infrastructure to rapidly diagnose H5N1 infection at the initial point of care (POC), as the virus is circulating in many regions that lack existing diagnostic capacity, even for seasonal influenza. In practice, diagnosis of viral infections is conducted in several different environments, each having specific features, and therefore having somewhat different test requirements ( Table 1) ."

Loci linked to chronicity (Pia5 and Pia6; Fig. 2f ,g,h) were not associated with onset or severity of arthritis (Fig. 4) . Our analysis showed that the DA strain has a recessive disease-promoting allele at Pia6 and an additive allele at Pia6 (Fig. 4) . One of the loci controlling chronicity, Pia5, is located in the vicinity of the previously described Cia3 locus, which controls collagen-induced arthritis 7 , and the Lyp/Iddm1 locus, which is associated with lymphopenia, diabetes and thyroiditis in the BB rat 8,9 (Fig. 3) . This may indicate the presence of a common susceptibility gene for several autoimmune diseases. The MHC region has been found to control the development of chronic arthritis in PIA using LEW congenic strains 6 , and the designation Pia1 is therefore reserved for this locus. Pia1 was, however, not found in the present cross, possibly due to the fact that none of the parental strains had the most susceptible haplotype (RT1 f )."

76,1629880,"No vaccine or therapeutic agent has been approved for the prevention and treatment against MERS-CoV infection to date. Several laboratory studies proposed vaccine candidates, based on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) antigen, which induce neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies inhibit RBD from binding the host receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4; also known as CD26) [4] , An alternative strategy is to use virus-specific therapeutic human antibodies that can be rapidly developed to neutralize the virus during infection. Indeed, some monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) cloned from humans using various platforms have shown considerable MERS-CoV-neutralizing potency along with therapeutic or prophylactic efficacies in animal models [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Additionally, nanobodies and camel/human hybrid antibodies have been suggested for treatment of viral infection [13, 14] . Most recently, a research group isolated mAbs from a MERS patient via B cell immortalization, which showed promising therapeutic and prophylactic potential against MERS-CoV infection in a mouse model [8] . Moreover, targeting multiple antigenic sites on spike might be advantageous, suggesting the possibility of combination therapy with RBD-specific antibodies for escape-mutant prevention [11, 15] . To date, two phase I human clinical trials of therapeutic antibody candidates, humanized mAbs (REGN3048, REGN3051) and human polyclonal anti-MERS immunoglobulin G (IgG; SAB-301) from transchromosomic cattle have been completed [16, 17] .

77,1463889,"Previous studies have reported that SR-rich region in SARS-CoV is crucial for N protein multimerization and the interaction with membrane (M) protein [35, 36] . In the SR-rich region of N protein, there was only 2-aa difference between SARS-CoV-2 (referential type) and SARS-CoV. Therefore, the similar function of SR-rich region may exist in SARS-CoV-2, although there is no relevant research reported at present. Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 harbors one more SRXX repeat fragments in the 193 th -196 th aa of N protein. Previous research reported that the SR-rich region of SARS-CoV in 184 th -196 th aa was crucial for N protein multimerization and the deletion of this region completely would make N protein abolish the self-multimerization [36] . Besides, SRXX repeat fragments may play an important role in SARS-CoV infection [37] . We noted that SARS-CoV could be regarded as a deletion of SRXX in SR-rich region compared to SARS-CoV-2, and the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher than SARS-CoV, thus, whether SR-rich region of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in this process is worth to explore. However, the research about SR-rich region in coronavirus was still limited at present. Especially, unlike SARS-CoV, the region in SARS-CoV-2 is still constantly evolving, implying that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 may employ a more flexible replication mechanism and even interaction with M protein. A study reported that the N protein of SARS-CoV can specifically bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A1 and plays an important role in RNA replication and transcription, especially, the key binding region is in the SR-rich region of SARS-CoV N protein (aa 161-210), the interaction between human hnRNP A1 and SARS-N protein may be the key to SARS-CoV replication and transcription [37] . Whether such a similar mechanism exists in SARS-CoV-2 is still unclear. However, in human cells, there are more than 20 hnRNPs has been discovered, and SR-rich region of SARS-CoV-2 showing distinctive polymorphism, whether the SARS-CoV-2 can bind to one of these hnRNPs needs more verification. It might provide a new hint in understanding the process of SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. Besides, the potential phenotype changes related to nonsynonymous substitution hotspots on third SRXX repeat fragments of SARS-CoV-2 may be also worth attention."

[19] reported on After three TAIL-PCRs, a 900 bp band (top) and a 300 bp band (bottom) were detected by agarose gel. The PCR products were sequenced. The 900 bp PCR products consisted of a partial sequence of LTR and a partial sequence of the 5 0 end of ACE2 gene. (B) A 300 bp band was detected in genomic DNA from F5 cells by PCR using primers specific to LTR and the ACE2 gene. Genomic DNAs from non-transduced HeLa cells and Vero E6 cells were used as control.

However, the current laboratory test is time-consuming, and a shortage of supply test kits may not meet the needs of a growing infected population. RT-PCR testing for 2019-nCoV may be falsely negative due to laboratory error or insufficient viral material in the specimen."
80,2227618,"As with CD, a principal cause of vaccination failures in pups is maternal antibody interference, which has been amply exploited by biologics producers in promoting ""new vaccines"" that claim to immunize pups earlier than do competing products. The reality is that live virus vaccines differ in their capacity to evade low levels of antibodies and no vaccine has been shown to immunize pups at the time when they have maternal antibody levels that prevent infection with virulent virus. The concept of the ""critical period"" (or ""window of vulnerability"") was developed to describe that period of time when pups become susceptible to infection with virulent virus, but respond unpredictably to vaccines (Carmichael, 1989; Pollock and Carmichael, 1990) . The critical period has been shown to range from 2-5 weeks, but it is briefer with some vaccines than with others; that is some vaccines may immunize pups earlier than to others, regardless of age (Car-michael, 1989 (Car-michael, , 1997 Hoskins et al., 1995; Schultz, 1995) . Failures to respond to efficacious vaccines relate to prevaccination antibody titers, but not age."

82,1196477,"Since the first case outside Hubei was reported on 19 January [5] , for the initialization of the model we could assume that number of infected individuals on 23 January outside Hubei was equal to the number of cumulative cases outside Hubei up to that day. To calibrate the model, we estimated the number of cases from 24 January till 31 January outside Hubei based on case exportations, using the methodology of [15] , assuming that exportations after 24 January were only from outside Hubei. Based on the maximal likelihood of case numbers that produce the observed number of exportations using EpiRisk [32] , we estimate that the reported confirmed cases represent only 6.3% of the total cases for the regions outside Hubei (other estimates for ascertainment rate were: 5.1% [22] , 10% in [38] , and 9.2% (95% confidence interval: 5.0, 20.0) [39] ), see the inset in Figure 1 . The initial values for the exposed compartments in the SEIR model were selected such that the model output was consistent with the estimated case numbers outside Hubei between 24 January and 31 January. Solving the compartmental model, we obtained final epidemic sizes for various reproduction numbers and control efforts (see Figure 1 ), providing upper bounds for the cumulative number of cases C outside Hubei."
83,1424194,"Routes of infection could not be retrieved in this retrospective study. Recently, Giannella et al. demonstrated that influenza virus could be detected in a considerable proportion of patients from intensive care units in whom influenza was not suspected clinically and nosocomial influenza was reported in 66% of those patients [14] . This supports the notion that underreporting of nosocomial cases in our study seems likely since multiplex testing was initiated upon request of the physician only. Ideally, during influenza epidemics screening of all patients irrespective of ILI would allow early case detection and proper patient management including isolation or cohorting. However, data on overall benefit for the patients and overall costs of such an approach are lacking so far. We have now implemented an online-database in cooperation between the Institute of Virology and the Department of Environmental Health Sciences to detect nosocomial cases prospectively. Results from routine multiplex testing for respiratory pathogens are submitted on a daily basis and cases with a positive multiplex PCR result are now actively investigated. Preliminary analysis of our database showed a rate of 17% of nosocomial infections in 2014/15."

87,3110813,"Objective: In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. Methods: There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. Results: Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. Conclusion: Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds."
88,3041428,"Human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63 was first described in 2004 and is associated with respiratory tract disease of varying severity. At the genetic and structural level, HCoV-NL63 is similar to other members of the Coronavirinae subfamily, especially human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Detailed analysis, however, reveals several unique features of the pathogen. The coronaviral nucleocapsid protein is abundantly present in infected cells. It is a multi-domain, multi-functional protein important for viral replication and a number of cellular processes. The aim of the present study was to characterize the HCoV-NL63 nucleocapsid protein. Biochemical analyses revealed that the protein shares characteristics with homologous proteins encoded in other coronaviral genomes, with the N-terminal domain responsible for nucleic acid binding and the C-terminal domain involved in protein oligomerization. Surprisingly, analysis of the subcellular localization of the N protein of HCoV-NL63 revealed that, differently than homologous proteins from other coronaviral species except for SARS-CoV, it is not present in the nucleus of infected or transfected cells. Furthermore, no significant alteration in cell cycle progression in cells expressing the protein was observed. This is in stark contrast with results obtained for other coronaviruses, except for the SARS-CoV."
89,2424521,"Our study provides evidence on the correlation between knowledge, attitudes, and practices among different exposure groups. This has substantial implications for public health educators and planners in implementing pandemic preparedness plans. It was evident that the knowledge score was the main predictor of the attitude and practice scores with strong correlation between knowledge and practice scores and knowledge and attitude scores. On the other hand, attitude scores alone did not predict practice score and the correlation between attitude and practice scores was weak. This shows that good knowledge is important to enable individuals to have better attitudes and practices in influenza risk reduction. In a previous study on SARS, better knowledge was also found to equate with better adoption of precautionary practices [6] . Clear communication and provision of updated information also helped improve vigilance and preparedness during the current pandemic [11] . A recent study found that educating the public about specific actions to reduce risks and communicating about the government's plans and resources helped to improve compliance to good practices [9] . Of interest, higher educational status in our cohort was a significant negative predictor of good practice, showing that educational status alone does not determine behaviours. Two previous studies on influenza [9] and SARS [2] also showed that education level did not have any effect on uptake of recommended behvioural patterns. Regarding influenza vaccine uptake and education level, some studies have showed that a higher education level resulted in higher influenza vaccination uptake [20, 21] , while another study on influenza vaccination uptake showed varying influence of education levels on influenza vaccination in different countries [22] . As such, it is important to focus on inculcating the correct knowledge to individuals as it will influence both attitudes and practices. On the other hand, positive attitudes on its own may not translate into desired behavioral change in the absence of adequate knowledge. For the exposure groups, influenza cases had the highest practice scores of all 4 groups. Use of masks was also highest among the influenza cases. Having been infected with pandemic influenza appears to have a substantial impact in behavior and adopting risk reduction practices. Although most if not all of these influenza cases will not be re-infected by the same pandemic virus again, adopting these practices will place them and their close contacts at lower risk for other influenza and respiratory virus infections."

92,2037882,"Accumulating evidences have shown that COVID-19 infection follows a distinct but related stage progression. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) observed in a significant proportion of fragile patients, roughly after the second week, is apparently non-exclusively related to uncontrolled viral replication, but rather to an out-of-control host response. The initial immune response, involving Tolllike receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and other virus sensors in respiratory epithelial cells is critical in reducing the viral load and alerting the host [5] . The response begins with the recruitment of innate immunity. If viral self-propagation is not limited, the increasing number of infected epithelial cells and cell debrides trigger a massive cytokine release-the so-called 'cytokine storm'-with hyperinflammation and immunosuppression, characterized by increased Th17 and CD8 cytotoxic activity and decreased memory CD4 + T helper cells [6] . The antiviral immune response represents a balancing act between the elimination of virus and immunemediated pulmonary injury. Pathology studies revealed that lung injury starts at the epithelial-interstitium-endothelial interface with increasing vascular permeability and extravasation of immune cells (mostly macrophages and granulocytes). The exudation reduces surfactant production in the alveolar space, impeding alveolar patency and gaseous diffusion [7] . Infected epithelial cells and debris bind immune cell receptors, triggering the release of inflammatory cytokines (predominantly IL-6, IL-1 and TNF alpha) and activating fibroblasts. The second phase begins when uncontrolled viral propagation induces angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-directed cytotoxicity, triggering a vicious circle leading to hyperactivation of immune cells and worsening the hyperinflammation state. Patients also show lymphopenia with reduced B Cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells and CD16 + Natural Killer cells count, probably due to an increase in extravasation of dysfunctional lymphocytes and inflammation-induced apoptosis [8] . The cytokine storm leads to increased clotting, vascular inflammation, leading to disseminated thromboembolism, and hypotensive shock [6, 7] . Although a balanced immune response seems to keep the viral infection under control, a small fraction of patients evolves through all stages [9] . In these critical cases, the priority following severe lung damage is to reduce hyperinflammation [6] and thromboembolism that are associated the increase mortality."
93,1055311,"Yet, little is known about how potential outbound tourists behave when they are considering overseas travel during an Influenza pandemic. Understanding their behavior would help government agencies, tourism marketers, transport systems, and hospitality services cope with a crisis more effectively. This study classified the perceived risk for 2009 H1N1, a novel influenza virus that emerged in Mexico, as an obstacle which could discourage tourists from visiting other countries. For instance, if tourists who are planning international travel perceive risks from 2009 H1N1, such as suffering illness while abroad, they could postpone or cancel their plans (Reisinger & Mavondo, 2005) . We theorized that in a pandemic, potential tourists would consider voluntary personal non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) which could decrease their risk of 2009 H1N1 infection while traveling. Tourists may choose NPI because of the delay in the production of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines, or because of limited vaccine availability in their country (Chaturvedi, 2009) . Personal NPI include getting better knowledge of the disease and pandemic; improving personal hygiene practices while traveling; using social distancing to avoid suspect people or places; and monitoring personal health before and after the trip (Nicholl, 2006) ."

Ei-ne Metaanalyse bleibt daher ohne gute Empfehlung zum Infektionsrisiko beim Einsatz von Verneblern [16] .

Für H1N1-Infektionen konnte gezeigt werden, dass anhand des Gehalts an infektiösem Material in der Umgebungsluft das Infektionsrisiko, das von einer Verneblermaske ausgeht, im Vergleich mit Basiswerten nicht nennenswert größer zu sein scheint, während Maßnahmen wie z. B. Absaugen oder Bronchoskopieren zu einer deutlich höheren Freisetzung von Virus-RNA führten [11] . Einige Autoren schließen ein relevantes Risiko durch Vernebler aus [11, 12, 14] .

95,2664980,"Flow cytometric analysis revealed that cholesterol extraction by MbCD treatment could reduce the expression level of cell surface ACE2 at a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) , suggesting that there may be some association of ACE2 with lipid rafts. We therefore performed membrane flotation assays to examine the localization of ACE2 in Vero E6 cells before or after SARS-CoV adsorption. As shown in Fig. 4B (upper four panels), ACE2 was mainly detected in fractions 9, 10 and 11, where TfR, used as a non-raft marker, was also enriched. Markers of lipid raft fractions, Caveolin-1 and GM1, were shown to be localized in the detergent-resistant membrane fractions, where ACE2 was not enriched. The data above suggested that ACE2 were not directly associated with lipid rafts. Next, we further examined possible shift of ACE2 location after virus adsorption (Fig. 4B, lower two panels) . However, no apparent shift of ACE2 to rafts area was observed, suggesting that the virus binding could not trigger the re-localization of ACE2 in rafts membranes."

Prior to disembarkation, the quarantine officers used portable thermoscanners to screen the temperature. In the following, all passengers were interviewed regarding whether they have any symptoms suggestive of upper raspiratory tract infection, including fever and cough. Of the 565 passengers, 63 were symptomatic. Second, the passengers were tested for presence of 2019-nCoV using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and eight passengers (1.4%) were determined to have the virus. Importantly, most of the individuals positive for the virus were asymptomatic (five passengers), while only the other three had symptoms consistent with 2019-nCoV infection, indicating that the dataset generated from this process can help investigate the full spectrum of infection including mild and asymptomatic infections."

100,303190,"Moreover, according to current evidence, the principal route of transmission of COVID-19 is from human to human. 114, 115 COVID-19 spread between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Droplet transmission occurs when there is close contact with a person with respiratory symptoms such as coughing or sneezing, who may spread potentially infectious droplets. Transmission may also occur by direct contact with infected persons and indirect contact with infected surfaces or objects. COVID-19 can persist on inanimate objects for days but can be efficiently inactivated by common disinfectants. Airborne transmission may be possible when a high risk of aerosolization procedures are performed, such as endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy. The virus is also detected in stool specimens, and consequently, the feco-oral transmission is also hypothesized. [116] [117] [118] [119] The high transmissibility of COVID-19 may be explained by its demonstrated presence in the upper respiratory tract of asymptomatic or presymptomatic subjects with viral loads comparable to those detected from symptomatic patients. The real proportion of asymptomatic cases is unclear, ranging from 1% to 78% in different studies. Transmission from asymptomatic patients infected with COVID-19 most likely contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of pandemic but further studies are needed to more accurately estimate the proportion of genuinely asymptomatic cases and their risk of transmission. [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] COVID-19 has been reported among all age groups. The median incubation period of COVID-19 infection is 4-5 days with a range up to 24 days. 119, 127 COVID-19 infection case is classified by the WHO into suspected, probable, and confirmed ( Table 4) . 128 Clinical severity of the infection varies, ranging from asymptomatic forms to critical diseases. Common symptoms are fever, dry cough, malaise, lethargy, shortness of breath, sore throat, and myalgia. Headache, conjunctivitis, productive cough, and diarrhea are also described. Mild forms present as a common cold, and severe cases may worsen in pneumonia that may evolve to ARDS, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction. More severe clinical pictures are associated with stronger immune response and with the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Adverse outcomes are common in elderly patients and those with underlying diseases. The need for intensive care admission is in 25-30% of patients. The fatality rate is estimated to range between 2 and 3%. [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] About 2% of COVID-19 confirmed cases are children. [124] [125] [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] [131] [132] [133] [134] 135 Generally, children appear to be less likely to develop a severe form of COVID-19 infection, and commonly they have a mild clinical course with a good prognosis. Few children may evolve into lower respiratory infections. Probable reasons include having an immune system still immature, healthier respiratory tract, and less underlying conditions than adults. 136 Most of them have an infected contact history with family members. Moreover, children, especially those with asymptomatic or milder form, may represent significant spreaders. Pediatric patients appear to be likely as adults to become infected but are less likely to develop symptoms. However, future studies are needed to understand the role of children in the transmission of the virus. [137] [138] [139] Current researches show that the median age of infection in pediatric cases is 6-7 years. In symptomatic cases, symptoms are typical of acute respiratory infections and frequently included fever (59%) and cough (46%), which may be accompanied by nasal congestion, runny nose, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, wheezing, myalgia, and expectoration. Few children have an atypical presentation with gastrointestinal manifestations, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Low oxygen saturation of less than 92%, dyspnea, cyanosis, and poor feeding, are less common than adults. Among infants, symptoms such as irritability, reduced response, and poor feeding could be the main signs of infection. Family clustering occurred for all infected infants. Rarely infants require intensive care or mechanical ventilation or have any severe complications. Common symptoms of pediatric age are summarized in figure 1 . The majority of children recovers 1-2 weeks after the onset of the disease. Regarding biochemical results, leukopenia and lymphopenia are frequent in children. Elevation of transaminases, myoglobin, muscle enzymes, and D-dimers might be seen in severe cases. [140] [141] [142] [143] [144] [145] [146] Dong et al. reported that 94% of 2143 pediatric patients affected by COVID-19 developed an asymptomatic, mild, or moderate form of infection. A severe disease characterized by dyspnea, central cyanosis, and oxygen saturation of less than 92% was reported in 5% of cases. A critical disease characterized by ARDS and multiple organs failure was reported in less than 1% of cases. 141 The prevalence of severe and critical disease appears higher in younger children, particularly in children aged <1-year-old and in children with underlying diseases. To date, death was an uncommon event reported in one 10month-old infant with intussusception and multiorgan failure and in one 14-year-old boy. 145, 147 Other systemic symptoms appear to be related to the infection, but their link has not yet been demonstrated. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a large number of rashes, urticaria, and vasculitis affecting hands and feet of healthy children and adolescents have been reported as well as itching, burning, difficulty in joint movements and pain. 142 Recently, the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the development of cardiac diseases in children has been hypothesized. Belhadjer et al. have reported a large number of febrile children resulted positive for COVID-19 admitted in intensive care units for acute heart failure associated with a multisystem inflammatory state. In most of the children, clinical features appeared similar to those of Kawasaki syndrome: lasting fever, cutaneous rash, lymphadenopathy, persistent activation of systemic inflammation and positive response to intravenous immunoglobulin. 148 Similar clinical features have subsequently been reported in children with COVID-19 positive serology. 149, 150 As in COVID-19 infection, Kawasaki syndrome is triggered by proinflammatory cascade activated primarily by innate immunity response. However, further studies are needed to establish the real pathogenetic relationship between emerging COVID-19 and Kawasaki-like syndromes. 151 Dufort et al. 152 have recently reported the emergence of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in New York State coincidental with widespread SARS-CoV-2 transmission, which can better clarify the relationship between Kawasaki Disease and COVID-19. Among 191 children admitted to the New York hospitals for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), 95 patients had a laboratory-confirmed acute or recent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] infection. This hyperinflammatory syndrome manifested with dermatologic, mucocutaneous, and gastrointestinal features associated with cardiac dysfunction. Of these 95 patients, a total of 36 patients (37%) received a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease or atypical (or incomplete) Kawasaki's disease; 7 of the 9 patients with coronary-artery aneurysms also received a diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease. 152 COVID-19 infection may also trigger the onset of other immune-mediated diseases such as immune thrombocytopenia, [153] [154] [155] [156] Evans syndrome, 157 and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. 158 Among radiological findings, ground-glass opacity, mono or bilateral infiltrates, mesh shadows, and tiny nodules are frequently detected. In severe cases, radiological alterations are diffused, presenting as a ""white lung."" However, radiologic evidence of pneumonia might be absent in 15-20% of children. 139, 140, [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] In selected cases, lung ultrasound might be useful in the managing and follow-up of COVID-19 infection. This radiological technique can precociously identify abnormalities including small pleural effusion and subpleural consolidation and appear more available then X-ray and CT. [164] [165] Clinical examination appears mostly negative for pulmonary signs, and in rare cases, rales and thoracic retractions have been reported. 161 Whether pregnant women and children born to affected mothers are more likely to have a worse outcome is currently unclear. Maternal-infant vertical transmission has not been documented. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from newborns delivered by infected women were tested for COVID-19, and all samples tested negative. 166 Data on the maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women infected with COVID-19 is limited. Most pregnant women with COVID-19 present with fever and coughing. Severe and critical maternal symptomatology have also been reported, but no women died. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome is preterm birth, occurring in 41% of cases while the rate of perinatal death is 7%, including one case of stillbirth and one neonatal death. There is no data on miscarriage for COVID-19 occurring during the first trimester. In more than a third of cases, fetal distress and frequent admission neonatal intensive care units have been reported. 166, 167 Rarely, cases of COVID-19 positivity in newborns have been reported. Common symptoms are fever, cough, lethargy, and vomiting milk. Mottled skin and moderate respiratory distress presented with tachycardia, tachypnoea, subcostal retractions, and low oxygen saturation are also described in newborn babies. [169] [170] [171] [172] [173] Although it can be severe in some cases, compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, COVID-19 causes less severe disease in children. A recent meta-analysis shows that children infected with COVID-19 have less fever than that other epidemic HCoVs. 174 Despite the rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 infection, additional data are needed to define the severity of the disease in children. The severity of the symptoms and the mortality rate will be better assessed in the future."

This measure raises ethical issues that require documentation of the modalities of quarantine at the field level and its social effects for contact persons. In Senegal, 74 people were in contact with the Ebola case coming from Guinea in September 2014. Of these, 34 members of the case's household were contained together at home and monitored by officers. The remaining 40 health care workers from two facilities were dispersed in their family households and monitored by telephone or during doctors' visits. The study is based on in-depth interviews with 43 adult contacts about their experiences and perceptions, with additional observation for interpretation and contextualization."
102,1262163,"High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) delivers humidified, warmed oxygen via specialised nasal cannula at flow rates up of to 60 L min -1 . Paediatric circuits typically deliver a lower maximum flow of up to 25 L min -1 . The WHO advises that HFNO should be used for selected adult patients with hypoxaemic respiratory failure 56 and that HFNO can reduce the need for intubation. 57 Patients using HFNO should be in a monitored area and anaesthetists should be available to intubate the patient should they clinically deteriorate, or not improve after a short trial of ~1 hour. 56 Exhaled aerosol dispersion of viral load during HFNO is of concern for the personal safety of staff caring for these patients in close proximity. A number of studies have measured air dispersion during HFNO 58, 59 , although precisely how this relates to viral droplet or aerosol particles remains unclear. Mean (SD) dispersion distances increased from 65 mm (15) to 172 mm (33) as flow increased from 10 to 60 L m -1 . This increased to 620 mm laterally if the HFNO fit was loose. 59 Consequently, current WHO recommendations suggest that HFNO should be avoided where airborne precautions and negative-pressure, airborne infection isolation rooms are not available. 60, 56 Both non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and HFNO should be considered to be aerosolising procedures. 58, 60 The use of NIV has previously been associated with the transmission of virus to healthcare workers during the previous SARS outbreak 61 , however since that outbreak in 2003 improvements in mask design may have reduced this risk. Measured air dispersion with a full-facemask continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system has been subsequently compared to CPAP with nasal pillows. 59 Air dispersion with full-facemask CPAP was negligible at both low pressure (5 cm H 2 O) and high pressure ventilation (20 cm H 2 O). CPAP with nasal pillows performed worse with a maximum mean (SD) dispersion of 207 mm (11) at 5 cm H 2 O, up to a dispersion distance of 332 mm (34) at 20 cm H 2 O. Therefore patients on CPAP should ideally be cared for in negative pressure facilities with staff wearing PPE appropriate for airborne contamination. 62 The New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG) recommend that where necessary, patients using NIV should be isolated in side rooms with doors closed. 62 If necessary, several patients, all of whom should have confirmed COVID-19, can be cared for in a ""cohort bay"". Appropriate filters should be used in all CPAP and NIV circuits. 61 High-flow nasal oxygen has been used to prolong the apnoea phase during tracheal intubation and to reduce intubation rates in acute respiratory failure. In China it has been used in patients with COVID-19 [63] , but there are no studies looking at virus spread by aerosol droplet production and transmission with HFNO. Environmental bacterial contamination has been investigated comparing high-flow nasal therapy to face mask in critically ill patients with pneumonia [64] . This was not associated with increased air or contact surface contamination by either Gram-negative or total bacteria, and these findings were supported by systematic review [65] . However, for patients with COVID-19 in the absence of any evidence of survival benefit compared to conventional oxygen therapy and the potential for greater environmental viral contamination national guidance recommends the avoidance of HFNO [66] Critical care"
103,523022,"There are many reasons to be interested in the microbiology of the built environment. The context for this study derives from three primary concerns. First, exposure to bioaerosol material can cause or can contribute to many important diseases. Second, adverse respiratory symptoms correlate well with indicators of indoor dampness (Fisk et al., 2007) . It is a reasonable hypothesis, although not yet well established, that the underlying cause of these associations is microbial. Third, the microbiology of spaces we occupy may influence the human microbiome in ways that could confer health benefits. Evidence for this last point is admittedly thin. There is growing evidence that people influence the microbiology of the spaces they inhabit (e.g., Lax et al., 2014) . Emerging evidence also indicates that some aspects of the human microbiome are important for health (Grice and Segre, 2012) . We further know that aspects of our personal microbiome can be influenced by individual factors such as diet and illness. So, it is not a large stretch to imagine that elements of our personal microbiome that matter for health might in fact be influenced by attributes of the spaces we inhabit, including their microbiology generally and their bioaerosol aspects specifically. Hanski et al. (2012) reported evidence supporting an analogous suggestion: 'rapidly declining biodiversity may be a contributing factor to . . . the rapidly increasing prevalence of allergies and other chronic inflammatory diseases among urban populations. . .. ' Following the introduction, the study is organized into two main sections. In 'Framing the issues,' I define a framework for considering indoor bioaerosol dynamics. That section also defines the scope and limitations of this study. It presents some empirical evidence about indoor bioaerosols to help establish a context for studying dynamics. The section outlines the use of a material balance as a first-principles method for linking process to outcome for indoor bioaerosols. The size of particles is described as a primary variable of concern. Regional deposition of bioaerosol particles in the respiratory tract is described as a process linking concentrations and exposure to dose. Opportunities and limitations for progress in understanding indoor bioaerosol dynamics are strongly influenced by measurement technology, so some of the key measurement methods are summarized. Evidence regarding infectious disease transmission by airborne routes is also assembled."
104,2927784,"Innate immunity in bats has been studied in several species mostly at the genome and transcriptome levels, and has shown notable similarity with other mammals (1, 14) . Common innate immune defense mechanisms are found in bats such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (15, 16) . Various types of interferons (IFN) have also been described in bats. The type I IFN response to viral infections was found to be similar to that of other mammals (17, 18) . Interestingly, high expression level of type I IFN ""IFNω"" was detected in bats, which is not common in other mammals (8) . Type II IFN or IFNγ was found to affect the replication of Hendra virus in black flying fox Pteropus alecto cells and of Sendai virus in cells from Brazilian free-tail bat Tadarida brasiliensis (19) whereas Type III IFN was reported to be produced in bats injected with Tioman virus (20) . These findings suggest that bats express diverse IFN pathways that could play an important role in controlling viral infections. The adaptive immune system in bats has been less studied, partly due to the lack of specific tools in particular the absence of bat-specific antibodies (21) and the striking poor crossreactivity of antibodies that recognize lymphocyte cell surface markers in other mammals (22) . Genomic and transcriptomic approaches have identified the presence of T cell subsets (23) . In a previous study, using cross-reactive antibodies specific to transcription factors, we were able to identify CD4 + and CD8 + T cell populations, and reported the unusual dominant proportion of CD8 + T cells in P. alecto secondary lymphoid organs, which may suggest that bat's adaptive immune system is geared toward controlling intracellular pathogens, typically viruses (22) . Other studies have described the detection of high titres of circulating IgG antibodies in bats (24) . Transcripts of IgM, IgE, IgA, and several IgG subclasses were also detected. Of interest, IgG antibodies were found in abundance in maternal lacteal secretions as opposed to IgA predominance in other mammals, which may have important implications for the transfer of maternal immunity and protection in the bat progeny against systemic infections (25, 26) . Presence of IgD in some microbats but not in megabats has also been reported, illustrating a significant variability in antibody species across bats species (8) ."
105,791196,"In the setting of a QTc value of 500 ms or greater, navigating and circumventing this QTc liability depends greatly on the riskbenefit calculus, and the decision rests with the treating clinician and patient. For example, in younger patients with COVID-19 (ie, <40 years) who have only mild symptoms and a QTc of 500 ms or greater, it may be reasonable to avoid treatment altogether because the arrhythmia risk may outweigh the risk of development of COVID-19erelated acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, in patients with a QTc of 500 ms or greater presenting with progressively worsening respiratory symptoms or at greater risk (ie, >65 years of age, immunosuppressed, and/or high-risk comorbid conditions) for respiratory complications, the potential benefit of QTcprolonging COVID-19 pharmacotherapies may exceed the arrhythmia risk. Therefore, the ultimate goal of QTc surveillance in the COVID-19 pandemic should NOT be to identify those who cannot receive these medications but to identify those with compromised or reduced ""repolarization reserve"" in whom increased QTc countermeasures can and should be taken to mitigate the risk of drug-related death from DI-TdP/DI-SCD. 25 Ultimately, much of the risk-benefit calculus awaits determination of the therapeutic efficacy of hydroxychloroquine, with or without concomitant azithromycin.

106,922451,"As regards the gastroenterological training, the COVID-19 outbreak led to a significant training gap, due to the trainees' employment in COVID-19 Units and TO the reduced volume of gastroenterological activities. According to the multivariate analysis, the factors most closely related to this feeling were the reduction in outpatients' activities and the non-involvement of the trainees by mentors in certain activities. Importantly, through this Survey we propose new possible solutions to address the training gap such as extending the training period or increase the number of future hands-on courses in collaboration with academies and societies. It is noteworthy that the training gap reported is even wider than that reported for surgical training programs [20] . One potential explanation is that in most European countries, the clinical activities of gastroenterologists partially overlap with those of internists. As a consequence, gastroenterologists are often involved in COVID-19 Units. Several authors proposed, as a possible solution, the involvement in telemedicine activities of the trainees with a light workload during the COVID-19 outbreak, although evolution of the health systems is necessary to reach this goal [20, 21] . Further innovative solutions may be the flipped classroom model, online practice questions, teleconferencing, procedural simulation, and videos, even if the useful hands-on skills remain outside of these solutions [10, 22, 23] ."
107,2354668,"Previously, the C. parvum subtype IIdA15G1 has been detected in cattle, sheep and goats in Iran, Malaysia, and Spain [34] [35] [36] [37] . It has also been found in humans from the Netherlands, Australia, Iran, Malaysia, and India [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . The IIdA15G1 subtype identified in this study was unlikely to have arrived via Uruguay or the United States because the C. parvum IId subtype family has never been found in the Americas [13] . It is also unlikely that IIdA15G1 was introduced from Australia because C. parvum has not been detected in Australian breeding cattle. Thus, the source of the cryptosporidiosis outbreak could be attributed to C. parvum contamination in the area surrounding the farm. The IIdA15G1 subtype has been found in rodents in China, with C. parvum isolates from animals all belonging to the IId subtype [14, 18, 27, 28] . Generally, IId is a major zoonotic subtype family reported in Europe (Hungary, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Romania, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and Serbia and Montenegro), Asia (Kuwait, Iran, Jordan, India, Malaysia, and China), Africa (Egypt and Ethiopia), and Australia [13, 14, 42, 43] ."

However, airport fever screening followed by laboratory confirmation by real-time RT-PCR 8 successfully identified approximately half, 45% (244/542), of imported dengue cases in the viremic stages on days 1-5 after onset of illness. Our results also indirectly demonstrate that about 55.0% (298/542) of imported cases were temporary, non-febrile, i.e., latent cases, undetected by airport fever screening, entering Taiwan with some risk of community transmission. We agree with the findings of a previous report 17 that 50-90% of dengue infection cases are asymptomatic, and therefore transmission of DENV into Taiwan via incoming travelers may be inevitable. Nevertheless, our findings that the total number of imported cases = 3.459 + 0.418 Â number of imported cases detected by fever screening (R 2 = 0.80, p < 0.05), and that the geographical heterogeneity was the number of indigenous cases À169.283 + 53.398 Â number of imported cases (R 2 = 0.61) during 2003-2007 when airport fever screening had been implemented, indicate that border screening might provide a guide to the total number of dengue imported cases and indirectly alert authorities of possible domestic outbreaks in southern Taiwan. The immediate quarantine of infectious cases could also help to block partial domestic transmission, reducing the risk to the population and the need for subsequent intervention, including vector control and medical care for patients. The efficacy of screening symptomatic passengers passing through Taiwan airports by NCIT was found to have a PPV = 30.5-62.6% when fever prevalence among passengers was <1%; this is similar to a previous report. 8, 18 However, the effect on mitigating community transmission in dengue epidemics was not significantly different between pre-2003 border control methods (filling out questionnaires) and post-2003 methods (fever screening). This limitation was attributed to latent dengue cases, resulting from asymptomatic infection and possibly other factors, such as passengers hiding their symptoms. 8, 18 All of these factors that could impair airport screening strategies should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression of DENV."

Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and her oxygen saturation values were 94% to 100% while breathing ambient air. The heart rate fluctuated between 120 and 140 beats per minute. The laboratory examinations on hospital day 10 showed elevated myocardial zymogram and abnormal liver function both recovered. On hospital day 11 (illness day 16), a third chest CT scan showed patchy shadows and ground-glass opacity were obviously absorbed ( Figure 1C ). In view of the patient's clinical manifestations and other laboratory findings, the Citrobacter freundii in 2 sputum cultures was considered as a colonized bacteria of the respiratory tract and was not being treated. Three pharyngeal swabs obtained from hospital day 10 to hospital day 13 were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR assays. Amoxicillin potassium clavulanate was discontinued on hospital day 11, and interferon α-1b was discontinued on the following day. According to the latest interim guidance of the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment in China, the patient met the discharge criteria. However, we found that her anal swabs collected on hospital day 11 and 13 were still positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Thus, the patient remained hospitalized. From February 16, 2020, she was transferred to another hospital for continued isolation and observation.

112,1462770,"Mechanical ventilation, though vital in supporting respiratory function in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure or ARDS, may promote lung damage, a phenomenon known as ventilator-induced lung injury. 28 Currently, we lack any guidelines or evidence to help us manage invasive mechanical ventilation in critically ill patients with COVID-19. It is well advised to adopt the guidelines established for patients with ARDS, 29, 30 with appropriate modifications based on the firsthand patient care experience in Wuhan (table 5) . This is justified as 67% of the ICU patients developed ARDS based on the recent report. 3 The ARDS lung-protective ventilation guidelines emphasize: (1) a tidal volume less than or equal to 6 ml/ kg predicted body weight; (2) a respiratory rate less than or equal to 35 breaths/min; (3) a plateau airway pressure less than or equal to 30 cm H 2 O; and (4) a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) greater than or equal to 5 cm H 2 O. 31, 32 The tidal volume can be started at 8 ml/kg and then lowered with an ultimate goal of 6 ml/kg. Some clinicians believe that, as long as the plateau pressure can be maintained at less than or equal to 30 cm H 2 O, it may be safe to ventilate the patient with tidal volumes greater than 6 ml/kg predicted body weight. 33 The precise tidal volume for an individual patient should be adjusted according to the patient's plateau pressure, selected PEEP, thoracoabdominal compliance, and breathing effort. 29 It is advantageous to have a driving pressure (plateau pressure minus PEEP) below 12 to 15 cm H 2 O via tidal volume and PEEP adjustments in patients who are not spontaneously breathing. 34 In Wuhan, patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19 have a poor tolerance to high PEEP, likely as the result of the direct and severe lung damage by the virus and inflammatory reactions. The plateau pressure reaches 40 to 50 cm H 2 O when the PEEP is set at 18 cm H 2 O, Fio 2 at 100%, and the tidal volume at 6 ml/kg according to the Fio 2 and PEEP table. 32 The widely used practice in Wuhan, after lung recruitment maneuvers, is to set PEEP at 20 cm H 2 O and titrate down in a decrement of 2 to 3 cm H 2 O each time until the goals of oxygenation, plateau pressure, and compliance are all achieved. The commonly used PEEP in this patient population is less than 10 cm H 2 O."

115,2024523,"Diabetic patients with COVID-19 are at high risk of severe pneumonia and present a marked pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state compared to infected non-diabetic patients. Inflammation markers such as CRP, interleukin-6, ferritin and D-dimers are increased compared to non-diabetic patients while a marked inflammatory or cytokine storm is thought to be associated with a more pejorative prognosis [15] . In a review and meta-analysis of 15 studies including 51,845 patients with COVID-19 of whom 9,066 were severe cases, high age was independently associated with a severe form [16] . In this review, diabetes was also associated with the occurrence of a severe form with an RR of 2.81 (95% CI: 2.01-3.93), and this association persisted in a study with multivariate analysis taking into account age (RR 2.21, 95% CI: 1.33-3.66, p = 0.002) [17] . The risk of severe form was also increased by the presence of unbalanced or complicated diabetes in studies of patients with H1N1 viruses in 2009 and with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 [13] [14] [15] . In a retrospective observational study from March 1st to April 6th, 2020 and despite several limitations, the mortality rate was 28.8% in patients with diabetes and/or uncontrolled hyperglycemia, compared with 6.2% in patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia (p <0.001). In a cohort of 7,336 COVID-19 patients with or without diabetes from 19 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 and diabetes required more medical interventions. Despite these interventions, they also had significantly higher mortality: 7.8 % versus 2.7 % as well as a greater incidence of multiple organ injury. Patients with well-controlled blood glucose (glycemic variability within 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L) had a markedly lower mortality compared to individuals with poorly controlled blood glucose (upper limit of glycemic variability exceeding 10.0 mmol/L) (adjusted HR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.03-0.60, p = 0.008) during hospitalization [18] . These COVID-19 patients with uncontrolled hyperglycemia had a particularly high mortality rate. A variety of immune system abnormalities has been postulated to explain the association between hyperglycemia and immune dysfunction, including impairment in polymorphonuclear and monocytic white blood cell chemotaxis and phagocytosis, complement function, and cytokine dysregulation [19] . The fact that acute hyperglycemia plays a role which can be improved through effective glycemic management remained to be proved. In another study among over 500 patients with coronavirus, hyperglycemia was often transient and generally resolved after discharge from hospital in the majority of subjects [20] . The authors suggest that clinicians should treat hyperglycemia to achieve BG targets <180 mg/dL for most patients [19] . Klonoff et al. proposed four risk factors which can increase the risk of poor outcomes: a susceptibility to hyperglycemia from corticosteroid therapy, an inadequate glucose monitoring, a lack of contact with healthcare professionals and an inappropriate discontinuation of angiotensin receptor blockers [21] . CORONADO is an ongoing French study aiming to determine the risk factors of severe forms of the disease throughout the country [22] . In China, intensive care unit (ICU) patients were more likely to have diabetes, were older (66 years vs. 51 years), and had twice as many co-morbidities (72% vs. 37%) compared to those who did not need to go to the ICU [23] . Male sex was more frequent in infected vs non-infected patients, with a described proportion ranging from 56% to 82%; men also appeared to be over-represented in ICU patients (61% vs. 52%), but this difference was not statistically significant [3, 10, 23] ."

Notably, air samples, protective equipment, 222 anteroom and corridor outside of anteroom were negative. 35 Additionally, a case report of 223 emergency intubation in an unsuspected COVID-19 patient subsequently found to be positive 224 showed that no healthcare workers on surgical or N95 masks were infected. 36 Safe and optimal care of the parturient in the peripartum period requires a multidisciplinary team 243 approach. 37 The healthcare professionals that provide this coordinated care include obstetricians, 244 neonatologists, anesthesiologists, midwives and support services at the delivery suite. Here, we 245 highlight the acute care perspectives of the parturient, summarize existing evidence, and propose 246 an algorithmic approach for the management of the acutely ill parturient. When a COVID-19 parturient with desaturation (oxygen saturation decreases to ≤93%) presents 256 for emergency cesarean delivery, general anesthesia needs to be administered. This is done with When the parturient's oxygen saturation is adequate (94% and above), 6, 10 regional anesthesia If there is absence of maternal and / or fetal compromise, and emergency cesarean delivery is not 295 indicated, further plans for management of the patient are then made ( Figure 3 ). When 296 parturients are acutely ill, it may be challenging to differentiate the etiologies based on the presence of tachypnea and tachycardia. The percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen 298 (SpO 2 ) is non-invasive continuous monitoring that provides real time information on peripheral 299 oxygen saturation. It also provides indirect information on adequacy of pulmonary gas exchange, 300 cardiac function and intravascular volume status. There is correlation between oxygenation 301 measured by SpO 2 and invasive arterial blood gas. An arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) 302 of less than 60mmHg corresponds to SpO 2 of less than 90%. 44 Delivery units need to be 303 equipped with, and use continuous SpO 2 monitoring. Disposable low cost SpO 2 finger probes are 304 commercially available and need to be considered when multi-parameter monitoring is not 305 available. Knowing the (P-F ratio) which is the ratio between PaO 2 and fraction of inspired 306 oxygen (FiO 2 ) is useful in predicting the degree of lung compromise. 6"
118,208765,"The entire Bunyaviridae family contains more than 300 members arranged in four genera of arthropod-borne viruses (Orthobunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus and Tospovirus) and one genus (Hantavirus) of rodent-borne viruses [30, 36] . The Phlebovirus genus currently comprises 68 antigenically distinct serotypes, only a few of which have been studied. The 68 known serotypes are divided into two groups: the Phlebotomus fever group (the sandfly group, transmitted by Phlebotominae sandflies) comprises 55 members, and the Uukuniemi group (transmitted by ticks) comprises the remaining 13 members. Of these 68 serotypes, eight are linked to disease in humans, including the Alenquer, Candiru, Chagres, Naples, Punta Toro, Rift Valley fever, Sicilian, and Toscana viruses [30] . Phleboviruses have tripartite genomes consisting of a large (L), medium (M), and small (S) RNA segment."
119,2739464,"Within months after the identification of the SARS-CoV genome (Marra et al. 2003; Rota et al. 2003) , ACE2 was identified as a potential receptor in in vitro cell line studies (Li et al. 2003) . In these experiments, ACE2 protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates susceptible to SARS-CoV infection using the recombinant Spike protein of SARS-CoV (Li et al. 2003) . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 can bind to SARS-CoV Spike, and this binding supports 'syncytia formation' , the fusion of Spike proteinexpressing cells into large multinucleated cells that can also be observed in clinical SARS infections. Expression of ACE2 in cells that are usually not susceptible to SARS-CoV infection allows entry of live virus into the cell (Li et al. 2003) ; however, it was unclear whether ACE2 is required for a natural in vivo SARS infection."
120,2473643,"Although several bat species have been found to harbor several alpha and betacoronaviruses believed to be the ancestors of endemic human coronaviruses including HCoV-NL63 [13, 23] , bats may not have been a direct source of virus transmission to humans given that, CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV both make use of terrestrial mammals which are more likely to have contact with humans instead of bats as transmission hosts. Again, HCoV-229E is more closely related to their relatives in camels as compared to those in bats, indicating a probability of camels being intermediate hosts between bats and humans [14, 57] . Human coronavirus NL63 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 receptor for infection of target cells similar to SARS-CoV [20] and has been found to be able to replicate in swine cells in vitro [58] . No antibodies to HCoV-NL63 were found in any of the pigs tested in the present study as evidence of the fact that the ability to replicate in swine cells does not imply capability to infect an actual animal since several other barriers need to be surmounted for this to happen. Based on the results of the present study it may be concluded that cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and swine may not be intermediate hosts for HCoV-NL63. However, there have not been any reports of HCoV-NL63-related viruses circulating in Ghanaian bats, and as such, a spillover opportunity may not be present, and hence no likely infection. Surveillance of local livestock populations can also be performed for antibodies in areas where such HCoV-NL63-related viruses have been detected like in Kenya to confirm this [57] ."
121,1981027,"Induction of G2/M arrest by various viruses is thought to help establish a pseudo-S-phase state that may be more favorable for viral replication [ 8 ] . In this pseudo-S phase, although cellular DNA replication is complete, the cellular environment is such that the substrates and the machinery for DNA replication are available. This extends the amount of time available to DNA viruses for replication of their genomes. For some DNA viruses, this continuous replicative state can lead to an increase in viral genome copy number [ 8 ] . The levels of some viral proteins also increase in the G2/M phase [ 8 ] . For example, the results of one study demonstrated that infection with the Coronavirus, Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), caused an accumulation of infected cells in the G2/M phase. Interestingly, when the effects of the cell cycle perturbations on viral replication were examined, the IBV-infected, synchronized G2/M cells showed increased viral protein expression as compared to cells in the G0 phase or the asynchronously replicating cells [ 9 ] . Some RNA viruses, such as HIV, are more transcriptionally active in G2 [ 349 ] , and an increased level of transcription during G2/M may lead to production of more viral genomes [ 8 ] . Additionally, some viruses can utilize the different phases of the cell cycle to modulate protein expression via utilization of IRES-mediated translation; the IRES of HIV is upregulated in G2/M while that of HCV appears to be downregulated [ 8 , 374 , 375 ] . Apart from the effects on transcription and translation of viral proteins, a G2/M arrest may also impact virion assembly and release [ 8 ] . It has been proposed that the enveloped RNA viruses arrest the cell cycle prior to mitosis so as to maintain an intact intracellular organization [ 1 ] . This is benefi cial to the viruses whose assembly occurs in the Golgi apparatus and ER [ 376 ] . For example, coronaviruses, such as IBV, utilize golgi and ER structures for their protein processing and assembly [ 377 -380 ] . Finally, it is important to note that virusinduced G2/M arrest has been mostly studied in immortalized or transformed cell lines. Since cellular signaling pathways that regulate the cell cycle are usually altered in immortalized or transformed cell lines, the actual effect of the viral protein might be confounded in these systems [ 8 ] . Additionally, for many viruses, the consequence of a G2/M arrest for viral replication remains incompletely understood and requires further investigation, especially in systems that more accurately mimic sites of an authentic infection. Although all the studies described above focus on how viruses can initiate a G2 arrest, some viral proteins can also abrogate the G2/M checkpoint; examples of these viral proteins include HTLV1-Tax and EBV-EBNA3C. HTLV-1 Tax causes a G2 arrest in certain cell systems [ 372 ] ; however, in some cell systems, Tax can interact with Chk1, impair Chk1 kinase activity, and inactivate Chk1mediated phosphorylation-dependent degradation of Cdc25C,"
122,663544,"The reason for the similar effects on preventing influenza for the use of N95 respirators versus surgical masks may be related to low compliance to N95 respirators wear, 23 which may lead to more frequent doffing compared with surgical masks. 13 Although N95 respirators may confer superior protection in laboratory studies designing to achieve 100% intervention adherence, 24 the routine use of N95 respirators seems to be less acceptable due to more significant discomfort in real-world practice. 11 Therefore, the benefit of N95 respirators of fitting tightly to faces is offset or subjugated. 13 However, it should be noted that the surgical masks are primarily designed to protect the environment from the wearer, whereas the respirators are supposed to protect the wearer from the environment. 25 There are several limitations to this study. First, some RCTs had a high risk of bias due to lack of allocation concealment and blinding;"
123,2790773,"In this paper we present a mathematical model of the spread of the novel coronavirus that takes into account both the age and social contact structure [2] . We use it to study the impact of the most common social distancing measures that have been initiated to contain the epidemic in India: workplace non-attendance, school closure, ""janata curfew"" and lockdown, the latter two of which attempt, respectively, complete cessation of public contact for brief and extended periods. We emphasise that models that do not resolve age and social contact structure cannot provide information on the differential impact of each of these measures. This information is vital since each of the specific social distancing measures have widely varying economic costs. Our model allows for the assessment of the differential impact of social dis-tancing measures. Further, both morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19 infection have significant differences across age-groups, with mortality increasing rapidly in the elderly. It is necessary therefore to estimate not only the total number of infections but also how this number is distributed across age groups Our model allows for the assessment of such age-structured impacts of social distancing measures."
124,1981313,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic β-coronavirus that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [1] . Epidemiological evidence suggests that dromedary camels are the main zoonotic source of MERS-CoV [2, 3] . MERS-CoV causes a wide range of manifestations ranging from asymptomatic infections to mild or severe respiratory disease. Detection of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies (Abs) in humans and/or animals represents a valuable tool in diagnostics as well as epidemiological, virological, and immunological studies including evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Several serological assays have been developed and used for MERS-CoV, including ELISAbased assays, immunofluorescence assays, protein microarrays, and pseudovirus-based neutralization assays [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, most of these assays pose several drawbacks and limitations such as low specificity and sensitivity, need for expensive and special equipment and reagents, and/or highly trained technical staff, which could limit their use."
125,910453,"Our study provides insight about MERS-CoV knowledge and management practices among dentists in major Saudi cities. Dentists had Participants had a good knowledge of MERS-CoV transmission similar to dental professionals in Riyadh )10.61±1.19, out of 11( and contrary to healthcare providers in Makkah )18.3±3.9, out of 28(. 11, 14 Only 38.9% of the respondents in the present study knew that Corona is contagious which shows that there was an insufficient knowledge of the disease transmission. Previous studies showed that better knowledge about disease contagion was reported among healthcare providers 14,15 than among dentists 11, 12, 16 in spite of the close proximity of patient to provider that characterizes dental care. 17 In the preent study, participants' knowledge of Corona infection was modest. This agrees with similar findings of previous Saudi Arabian studies where 54% of dental students in Jeddah and 40.9% of healthcare providers in Makkah were able to identify disease symptoms; 12,14 while better knowledge )84%( was reported among health colleges' students in Najran. 13 The difference between the previous findings and this study can be due to the increased awareness on the virus from 2015 12, 14 to 2017. 13 The ability to identify persons infected with the disease is a ground stone in MERS-CoV infection prevention. 4 Screening of patients by checking for clinical features associated with Corona such as fever, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms may be instrumental in reducing the spread of MERS-CoV infection. 4, 8, 9 Similarly, <50% of respondents knew about the virus incubation period and methods to diagnose it. This is similar to the findings from previous studies conducted in Saudi Arabia where 30% of participants in Jeddah and 40.9% in Makkah knew about the incubation period. 12, 14 This knowledge is essential in determining the safe period to treat suspected patients. Only 33.6% of the participating dentists knew that PCR can be used to diagnose MERS-CoV. This was in agreement with Nour et al 14 who reported that 40.9% of healthcare providers also lacked knowledge of appropriate diagnosis method for the disease. Laboratory tests can confirm the virus in respiratory tract secretions, faeces, serum and urine. 10 In the present study, only 20.4% of the respondents attended CE on MERS-CoV. This disagrees with the emphasis on strict infection control guidelines by the national and international agencies to control MERS-CoV infection. 4, 8, 9 The Saudi MOH campaigns in healthcare facilities during Corona outbreaks were reported to influence healthcare providers' practices. 2, 4 The decreased participation in CE may be attributed to some barriers such as technical difficulties )inability of some facilities to conduct such training sessions due to lack of place, equipment, inter-professional conflicts(, heavy workload, lack of good role models, financial issues and unsupportive organizational culture. 18 These reported barriers may explain the knowledge gaps identified in the current study and the suboptimal history-taking practices. The low level of attendance may also explain the lack of association with adopting recommended management practices which disagree with previous literature supporting the role of CE in healthcare workers' compliance with infection control guidelines. 18 In the present study, 9.9% assessed animal contact history although recent studies proved that camels [19] [20] [21] and bats 22.23 were reservoirs for MERS-CoV. Our findings agree with Nour et al 14 who reported inadequate knowledge regarding the reservoir of infection among healthcare providers in Makkah as only 49.5% were aware of that."

Once transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), he was diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and intubated. Bacterial cultures of tracheal aspirate and blood remained negative throughout his ICU stay; for this reason, we assume that a viral pneumonia from the influenza A-H1N1 virus was the cause of ARDS. Five days after intubation (six from symptoms onset), the patient was still markedly hypoxemic (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio of 148 mmHg on a positive end-expiratory pressure of 18 cmH 2 O) while ventilated with a protective ventilatory strategy (tidal volume 5.2 ml/kg PBW, plateau pressure 27 cmH 2 O).

128,1536737,"(AAU UUU in HIV-1 frameshift region) occupy, respectively, the P and A sites. After peptide bond formation, the newly deac-tRNA and pept-tRNA in the P and A sites become engaged in the translocation process. Translocation begins after the binding of EF-G (or eEF2) associated to a GTP molecule to the ribosome. After GTP hydrolysis, the acceptor stems of the tRNAs move towards the E and P sites, respectively, on the large subunit (56) . The tRNAs occupy hybrid sites, where the acceptor stems of the tRNAs on the large ribosomal subunit are in an intermediate position between the postand pre-translocational state (P/E Ã and A/P Ã , where the star refers to a transition state). Such intermediate was recently identified using single-turnover rapid kinetics assays (57) ( Figure 7A ). The tRNA anticodon stemloops then move towards the E and P sites of the small ribosomal subunit, occupying first the intermediate E Ã /E Ã and P Ã /P Ã sites. The next step is the movement to the E/E and P/P sites, which drags the mRNA a distance of three nucleotides (i.e. one codon), after release of EF-GÁGDP from the ribosome. We propose that, for a fraction of ribosomes, the two tRNAs cannot drag the mRNA by three nucleotides, but only by two, due to the presence of the stimulatory signal that is resistant to unwinding. As a consequence, the two tRNAs are blocked in intermediate E Ã /E Ã and P Ã /P Ã sites and translocation is incomplete ( Figure 7B ). This hypothesis mainly relies on the cryo-EM structure from Namy et al. (34) , showing that the presence of a frameshift stimulatory signal stalls the ribosome in the translocation process. The next step of translation is the arrival of an incoming aa-tRNA bound to EF-Tu (or eEF1A) associated to a GTP molecule. Because of the incomplete translocation, the incoming aa-tRNA occupies an entry site (A Ã /T Ã ) that differs from the standard A/T entry site ( Figure 7C ). Codon-anticodon interactions are dynamic and can break and re-form. We propose that the tRNAs, which are located in intermediate sites and not in their respective The tRNAs in the E Ã /E Ã , P Ã /P Ã and A Ã /T Ã sites unpair from the mRNA, successively shift to the standard E, P and A/T sites and re-pair to the mRNA in the -1 reading frame. Note that whether there is pairing or not for the deac-tRNA occupying the standard E site is controversial (see the text)."

134,2787386,"Although not yet evaluated in swine, a new strategy for rotavirus vaccines is the creation of recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by the coexpression of the four rotavirus capsid genes (VP2/4/6/7) in a baculovirus expression system (Crawford et al., 1994) . The VLP vaccines administered with IFA have been tested in rotavirus seronegative mice and rabbits and as a maternal vaccine to enhance passive immunity in rotavirus seropositive cows (Fernandez et al., 1996) . The VLP vaccines were shown to be noninfectious (no RNA), stable, antigenically authentic, and highly immunogenic in the above species. They induced protective immunity against rotavirus shedding in vaccinated mice and rabbits and passive immunity against rotavirus diarrhea in calves fed colostrum from the VLP-vaccinated cows (Fernandez et al., 1998) . Thus VLP vaccines show promise as novel vaccines designed to induce mucosal immunity against rotavirus. Further research is needed to identify the optimal delivery systems and mucosal adjuvants for use with the VLP vaccines to most effectively stimulate mucosal immunity."

The HBoV-positive patients had a shorter hospitalization duration than HBoV-negative patients (P = .021). In contrast, Deng reported that HBoV-positive patients had a longer hospitalization duration. The longer hospitalization duration of HBoV-negative patients in our study may have been caused by the presence of other viruses (such as RSV and PIV3) in many of them. Also, hospitalization duration was significantly associated with age (≤6 months), maternal smoking during pregnancy, and a family history of asthma. 19 A high HMPV viral load contributes to development of fever. 4, 5 Indeed, HMPV-positive patients had a higher incidence of fever than HMPV-negative patients (P = .002) in our study."
136,181041,"Stimulation of mucus secretion. The results of our study indicate that capsaicin causes the degranulation of epithelial secretory cells both in pathogen-free rats and in infected rats. Considering that capsaicin can activate certain types of sensory nerves (Jancso et al. 1967; Gamse et al. 1980) , our observations suggest that the degranulation of both types of secretory cell is regulated by sensory nerves, either through a reflex or through an effect of a sensory nerve mediator. The latter possibility is consistent with evidence that mucous cells of the tracheal epithelium are not stimulated by parasympathetic agonists but are degranulated by irritants such as mustard oil, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and tobacco smoke (Florey et al. 1932; Lamb and Reid 1968; Jeffery 1978) , which activate sensory nerves, and by electrical stimulation of vagal sensory axons (McDonald 1988 b) ."

Our data support and extend the core conclusions of their mouse studies. We further show that mice lacking entire Ifitm locus exhibit a nearly identical disease course to those lacking Ifitm3 alone, and that their respective heterozygote littermates exhibit a phenotype intermediate between knockout and wild type mice. Morever, Ifitm3 is expressed on key IAV target cells in the lungs, and among murine Ifitms, is uniquely induced by type I and II interferons. Collectively these data make clear a primary role for Ifitm3 in the control of influenza A virus in mice."
138,234681,"Following the outbreak of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan and export of cases to countries worldwide, there was an urgent need to contain the spread of the novel virus. Quick and accurate identification of cases for isolation or quarantine remains a key pillar of public health efforts to contain an emerging epidemic. This strategy is dependent on accurate case definitions to identify patients for further management, including testing if available. Most of the current case definitions used globally are developed based on clinical signs and symptoms collated from COVID-19 in adults, which include either acute respiratory symptoms or more severe signs of lower respiratory tract infection [9] . While most adults with COVID-19 infection have fever, respiratory symptoms, and/ or chest radiograph changes, current data suggest that the majority of the infected children have mild or no symptoms [10] [11] [12] .

Of the 10 patients, 7 were hospitalized for respiratory illness in an acute care hospital, and 3 were residing in a long-term care facility at the time of illness. All 11 isolates were recovered in LLC-MK2 cells (Rhesus monkey kidney cells) and had focal rounding and cell destruction without apparent syncytia formation. No cytopathic effect was noted in MDCK or NCI-H292 cells. The original specimens had negative results of testing for influenza viruses when they were inoculated into embryonated eggs. The isolates did not adsorb erythrocytes and had negative results of testing by indirect immunofluorescence assays for influenza viruses A and B; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; adenovirus; and RSV (Bartels; Chemicon). Results of reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR or PCR assays for adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza viruses A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, rhinovirus, and RSV were negative for all 11 isolates."
140,2526984,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent of IB, is a coronavirus. The genome of IBV consists of positive sense single stranded RNA, approximately 27.6 kilobases in length [7] , that is encoded for four structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [8] . The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits [9] . The S1 subunit, located on the outside of virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the cell membrane of the host [7] . It contains virus neutralization and serotype-specific epitopes that are formed by amino acid within the defined hypervariable region (HVR); therefore, the molecular characterization of IBV is based on an analysis of the S1 gene [10] ."

142,1763287,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) cause major diseases in a variety of animals, including humans. Belonging to the order Nidovirales, the family Coronaviridae consists of two subfamilies, Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . The Coronavirinae subfamily consists of four genuses, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and the recently identified Deltacoronavirus (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses that contain single-stranded, positive sense RNA with a genome size of approximately 25.4-31.7 kb (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . Five CoVs have been identified in pigs: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV), and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). Within the past two years, PEDV and PDCoV were detected in the United States (US) domesticated pig population (Stevenson et al., 2013; Marthaler et al., 2013a Marthaler et al., , 2014b Li et al., 2014) ."
143,1162781,"In the ID outbreak, resident farm horses displayed clinical signs of disease including decreased appetite, lethargy, and fevers ≤38.9°C approximately 2-3 days after show horses returned from competition (American Miniature Horse Association World Championship Show). The 4 horses that returned from the show did not exhibit clinical abnormalities. A total of 7 horses tested fecal positive for ECoV on real-time PCR. Of these 7 horses, 4 (57%) had clinical signs of disease whereas 3 (43%) animals did not have clinical abnormalities. The first horse had signs of lethargy and anorexia 48 hours after exposure to the show horses. This horse was severely ill by 60 hours post exposure. Clinical signs in affected horses included fevers up to 38.9°C (three horses), tachycardia (one horse), encephalopathic signs (circling, head-pressing, and/or nystagmus in two animals), and lethargy (all horses). Of the 4 horses with abnormal clinical signs, 2 (50%) died during the course of disease. A miniature donkey (one of the animals that died) displayed signs of rapidly progressive nystagmus, decreased mentation, and recumbency. The donkey presented for veterinary care 36 hours after the onset of clinical signs, but because of rapid progression over the next 12 hours, the donkey was euthanized. The other animal that died, a miniature horse, developed an acute decrease in packed cell volume from 33% to 16% with ulcerations of the oral mucosa and tongue."
144,111299,"Viruses disseminate in the CNS by three ways: (1) within the extracellular space; (2) by axonal transport; and (3) via direct cell-to-cell transmission. Infectious agents, including viruses, prions and bacteria, have been shown to spread within axons [38] . Neurovirulent viruses, including herpes simplex, rabies, influenza, and Borna disease viruses, can be anterogradely or retrogradely transported in axons [38, 55] . In some instances, viruses can be transported intra-axonally more than 1 m, yet this journey occurs intracellularly. Therefore, the virus cannot be inactivated by neutralizing antibody during its transit, and may spread in the CNS without inducing an anti-virus immune response while within the cell. When viruses can spread only intra-axonally and/or via direct cell-to-cell contact, they could potentially escape the attack of antiviral drugs or neutralizing antibodies."
145,1984672,"SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 all have their origins in zoonotic viruses (11) . The animal source of COVID-19 has not been confirmed yet, but early research suggests a high possibility of origin in enzootic bat viruses (12) . It is not the first time an epidemic has been caused by wild animals. There have been six major epidemics. (Hendra, Nipah, SARS, MERS, Ebola, and COVID-19) from 1994 to 2020 caused by proven or suspected bat-borne viruses (13) . Transboundary and emerging diseases account for a larger share of human infectious illnesses. Illegal wild animal trade has opened a Pandora's box, in which various virus are sealed. Additionally, the dietary culture, including eating game food animals such as civet, bat, snake, and pangolin, has the potential for animal-to-human transmission (14) . The use of wild animal parts, such as tiger bones, bear bile, rhino horns, and pangolin scales, in traditional Chinese medicine, also provides opportunities to switch viruses to new hosts and cause human infection, which should be completely replaced with some substitutes. Now, more Chinese people are pushing to end wildlife markets. The management of China's vegetable markets (generally called by the Chinese) should also be improved. Vegetables and fruit, seafood, poultry, game meat, grain, and prepared food were also sold in the same market, which have the potential to be the origin of an epidemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 has prompted China to speed up biosecurity legislation, including the management measures of the vegetable markets. On Feb. 24, 2020, China officially imposed a total ban on trade and consumption of wild animals to protect biodiversity and to help the war against COVID-19."
146,2921422,"Recent studies have suggested that bats are the natural reservoir of a range of coronaviruses (CoVs), and that rhinolophid bats harbor viruses closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, which caused an outbreak of respiratory illness in humans during [2002] [2003] . We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group. These shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits. This fi nding has implications for the emergence of SARS and for the potential future emergence of SARS-CoVs or related viruses. S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in November 2002 in southern People's Republic of China (1) , and a SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identifi ed as the etiologic agent (2) . These events and the identifi ca-tion of SARS-CoV in animals associated with the wildlife trade in southern China (3) have led to a rapid resurgence of interest in CoVs of different origins. This resurgence led to discovery of 2 novel human CoVs (4, 5) ; identifi cation of SARS-like CoVs in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus macrotis, R. ferrumequinum, R. pearsoni, and R. sinicus) (6, 7) ; and identifi cation of other CoVs in bat species (R. sinicus, R. ferrumequinum, Miniopterus magnater [M. magnater has been misidentifi ed as M. schreibersi (8) in reports on SARS-like CoV], Pipistrellus abramus, P. pipistrellus, Tylonycteris pachypus, Myotis ricketti, and Scotophilus kuhlii) (7, (9) (10) (11) (12) .

Continued improvement in diagnostics has revealed that half of the cases of IPA occur in the ICU, in patients who are often nonneutropenic [3, 4] . Severe influenza infection is a wellknown risk factor for developing IPA in non-neutropenic patients; a syndrome termed influenza-associated aspergillosis (IAA) [4] [5] [6] . A damaged respiratory epithelium, dysfunctional mucociliary clearance and a local immune paralysis were demonstrated to be key pathophysiological factors [4] . Supported by the hypothesis that alveolar damage facilitates fungal invasion, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has frequently been associated with IPA in the ICU [6] . With this in mind, the existence of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is deemed likely."

150,2975080,"Our results can be used to further refine the current model of membrane fusion of SARS-CoV (Fig. 9) . Whereby, helical structures of FP, IFP and PTM, along with the TM anchor, insert into the membrane and may align with the six-helix bundle structure of HR1 and HR2 resulting in possible juxtapositioning of the host and viral membranes. The high hydrophobicity of the fusion active structure made of by these helices of the fusion protein would cause membrane mixing and eventually formation of the fusion pore. In addition, the emergence of highly infectious coronavirus termed MERS has prompted discovery of anti-SARS drugs. The fusion peptides of SARS-CoV have been found to be active against viral infection possibly due to their interactions with membranes [10, 60] . Thus, 3-D structures of fusion peptides and membrane fusion mechanism may be further utilized to develop drug against SARS."

156,1635798,"Our results indicate that Mass Tag PCR is a sensitive and specific tool for molecular characterization of microflora. The advantage of Mass Tag PCR is its capacity for multiplex analysis. Although the use of degenerate primers (e.g., enteroviruses and adenoviruses, Appendix Table and Table 1 ) may reduce sensitivity, the limit of multiplexing to detect specific targets will likely be defined by the maximal primer concentration that can be accommodated in a PCR mix. Analysis requires the purification of product from unincorporated primers and mass spectroscopy. Although these steps are now performed manually, and mass spectrometers are not yet widely distributed in clinical laboratories, the increasing popularity of mass spectrometry in biomedical sciences and the advent of smaller, lower-cost instruments could facilitate wider use and integrated instrumentation. In addition to developing additional pathogen panels, our continuing work is focused on optimizing multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput. Potential applications include differential diagnosis of infectious diseases, blood product surveillance, forensic microbiology, and biodefense."

We now have the first molecular evidence of airborne IAV in an elementary school, during a portion of the influenza season when students were exposed for appropriate durations to densities of influenza-laden particles that could facilitate infection. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the school-aged population, our data provide justification for considering schools as influenza hotspots, warranting further study to determine the relationship between airborne IAV densities and student health to improve influenza management in the greater community."
158,909020,"Approximately 2 billion people are exposed to malaria with morbidity surpassing 250 million cases and close to 1 million deaths per year [1] . Accurate diagnosis is critical for the proper treatment of malaria [2] . The existing tools for the diagnosis of malaria include microscopy, parasite antigen/enzyme detection kits (commonly referred to as rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)) and molecular tools (reviewed in [3] ). Each of these diagnostic tools has its own advantages and limitations. At present, microscopy and RDTs remain the only feasible options for malaria detection in many endemic countries. Microscopic diagnosis is the oldest method, can provide quantitative data and can identify species when used appropriately. Lack of infrastructure and training in most endemic countries has made microscopic diagnosis challeng-ing which has contributed to recent interest in deploying RDTs more broadly. The current RDTs detect parasite antigens such as histidine rich protein (HRP) -2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aldolase using immunochromatographic methods. The majority of the commercial RDTs detect HRP-2 which is expressed only by P. falciparum but not other species and therefore this test offers specific diagnosis of falciparum malaria. A limitation of this test is that HRP-2 can persist in the blood for several days after the parasites are cleared therefore the assay cannot accurately tell whether someone has a current or recently treated infection. Another concern about this test is the recent discovery that up to 40% of P. falciparum parasites in parts of South America have deleted the HRP-2 gene (which leads to false negative results) [4] . Most non-HRP-2 based tests (LDH and aldolase) are commonly pan-species test that allow for the speciation of P. falciparum and/or non-falciparum species when used in conjunction with HRP-2 based tests. Therefore, nucleic acid-based molecular methods are a potentially good alternative for malaria diagnosis as they can accurately differentiate all human-infecting Plasmodium species and detect low levels of parasitemia. PCR-based diagnosis recently helped to identify P. knowlesi in humans which had been misdiagnosed using microscopy [5] . Unfortunately, the current PCR-based methods are beyond the capacity of most malaria-endemic countries because they require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and training which makes these techniques expensive and technically challenging to implement in simple clinical laboratories or field settings. However, as progress is made towards better malaria control and eventual goal of elimination, more sensitive diagnostic tools will be required in order to detect asymptomatic low level parasitemia. Therefore, further efforts are needed to develop next generation molecular tools for field use with a goal that such tools can complement, or in some situations, replace the existing molecular methods for malaria diagnosis and operational programs such as monitoring and evaluation of control and elimination programs."
159,1984812,"Autophagy inhibitors including CQ, HCQ, and others with related chemical structures are known to prevent the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and blocks the later stages of autophagic flux (30) . CQ, in addition to its inhibitory effects on autophagy, has been reported to have broad antiviral effects through several mechanisms of action. One in particular is the disruption of the early steps in the viral life cycle including the release of the virus from the endosome when endocytosis is used for viral entry (31, 32) . Given the fact that the basic properties of CQ and similar molecules lead to their accumulation in acidic compartments and raise their pH, viruses that depend on low acidic pH for entry, uncoating, and replication can no longer execute these functions. While they exert multiple cellular effects, their characterized inhibition of autophagic flux and elevation of vesicular pH is consistent with the antiviral efficacy in vitro (33) ."
160,1628384,"To examine the viral growth ability in chicken embryos, a realtime reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method was established. According to the sequences of IBV from GenBank, primers were designed based on conservative area in the 5 0 -UTR. The upstream primer was 5 0 -CCGTTGCTT GGGCTACCTAGT-3 0 , and the downstream primer was 5 0 -CGCCTAC CGCTAGATGAACC-3 0 . The amplification product was cloned to pMD18-T vector (Takara) as a positive plasmid and its concentration was measured. A gradient dilution of 5 Â 10 2 -5 Â 10 8 copies/lL of the plasmid was used as template for quantitation test. By plotting the cycle threshold (CT) values against the copies of the plasmid, the standard curve was generated. 18 10-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs (six eggs/group) were inoculated with rH120, rIBYZ, and rH120-S1/YZ at a dose of 10 7 viral RNA copies/100 lL, and used for growth curve experiments. The allantoic fluids were collected separately by syringe from the six inoculated embryonated eggs of each group at 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72 , 96 h per inoculation. RNA was extracted from the allantoic fluids using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using a PrimeScript RT Master Mix Perfect Real Time Kit (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan). The viral copies were measured by absolute quantitative method of Realtime PCR, which was performed using SYBR Ò Premix Ex Taq TM II (TaKaRa, Otsu, Shiga, Japan) on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System. The standard curve was plotted against the log of the template copy number.

They were given a list of 6 places (public transportation; entertainment places such as cinemas, restaurants and theaters; shops; work or school; hospital; or home) and asked in which of these they thought they would run the greatest risk for infection. They were then randomly given 1 of 2 scenarios: a high-risk scenario in which over a 5-week period, 10% of their fellow inhabitants of all ages would be seriously ill with infl uenza and 0.1% would have died of the disease; and a low-risk scenario in which these rates were 2.5% and 0.025%, respectively. These scenarios were presented to the respondents in terms of rounded numbers of cases and deaths, scaled to their jurisdictions' population size (rather than rates). Respondents were next given the following list of 8 precautionary behavior modifi cations and asked whether they would adopt any of them: avoid public transportation (e.g., trains, buses, airplanes); avoid going out for entertainment (e.g., bars, restaurants, theaters, cinema); limit shopping to the essentials; take leave from work; keep children out of school, even if school remains open (only adults with children were asked this question); limit physical contact with friends and family; avoid seeing doctors, even when sick from something unrelated to fl u; and stay indoors at all times."
162,1043246,"Concluding remarks ACE2 is a major receptor for SARS-CoV, and its interaction with the S-protein can be targeted by therapeutics and vaccines. SARS-CoV S-protein is a class I fusion protein that can be inhibited by strategies known to be effective against related viral GPs. Fusion inhibitors are already available and will be complemented by compounds that target different steps of SARS-CoV entry. Vaccines designed on the basis of the S-protein are promising, but require thorough evaluation in various animal models before administration to humans. Future studies will reveal detailed insights on the structural organization and membrane fusion activity of the S-protein, which in turn will facilitate the generation of more potent inhibitors and vaccines candidates."
163,1984288,"The available reference data on the frequency of respiratory coinfections vary, although most reported percentages are higher than our results. In a study of 315 respiratory samples from children under 6 years of age, the FA-RP identified multiple coinfections (39%) with 2, 3, 4, and up to 5 different viruses. [29] Coinfection has also been found in 31%, [13] 36%, [9] 37%, [10] 42%, [30] and 51.8% [31] of positive respiratory samples. In our study, 9% of all our respiratory patients had multiple pathogens and 16% of all positive respiratory patients (almost 1 of 6 positive samples appeared with co-detections). There is no obvious explanation about the significance of lower frequency of co-detection in our series of patients. However, the predominance of HRV in our single and multiple detections is in accordance with previously published data. [32] Moreover, HRV/Adv and HRV/RSV combinations have been previously mentioned as the most frequent co-infection patterns. [30, 33] Interestingly, it has been suggested that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of rhinovirus infection, but that, if a co-infection occurs, both viruses cause clinical symptoms. [34] Regarding the age-related distribution of multiple pathogens, our observation that patients under 5 years of age were more likely to have multiple detections, is almost in accordance with the eliminated previously published data. [33, [35] [36] [37] Nevertheless, Tramuto et al have also noticed that most of their patients with multiple etiology were adults and elderly. [24] In conclusion, understanding the viral etiology and age-specific incidence of URIs can help identify risk groups and probably inform vaccine delivery. In this study, HRV predominated in almost all ages, Adv in the age group (≥2, <5) and Influenza was second in the ages (≥18). Finally, it was remarkable that the negative samples were mostly attributed to older ages, with a peak incidence in the age group (≥45, <65), confirming that, as the age of the patient increases, the positivity rate for the PCR decreases proportionately, [32] a finding that needs further explanation."
164,1203645,"Entry of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) into target cells is mediated by binding of the viral spike (S) protein to the receptor molecules, angiotensinconverting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) (1). Studies on SARS using infectious SARS-CoV require care because of the highly pathogenic nature of this virus, so an alternative methodology is needed. Recently, pseudotyped retrovirus particles bearing SARS-CoV S protein have been generated by several laboratories (2-4) . These pseudotyped viruses have been shown to have a cell tropism identical to authentic SARS-CoV and their infectivity is dependent on ACE2, indicating that the infection is mediated solely by SARS-CoV S protein. Pseudotyped viruses have proved to be a safe viral entry model because of an inability to produce infectious progeny virus. A quantitative assay of pseudovirus infection could facilitate the research on SARS-CoV entry, cell tropism, and neutralization antibody."

Therefore, the percentage of patients with cardiovascular diseases might have been underestimated given the urgency of data collection (history taking) within the wards during the outbreak. Our findings could have also been attributed to the relatively low proportion of patients with co-existing hypertension and coronary heart disease in our study. Nonetheless, the overall proportion of patients with comorbidities in our study [2] was in keeping with the previous publications [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .

PVP-I has well-established general antimicrobial activity, demonstrating in vitro efficacy against gram-positive, gramnegative and some spore-forming bacteria (clostridia, Bacillus spp.) and mycobacteria [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses [21] [22] [23] . Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated rapid virucidal activity of PVP-I products against Ebola virus, MERS-CoV and European reference enveloped virus [modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)] [24, 25] . Considering the proven in vitro efficacy, gargling with PVP-I may be an effective method of preventing the spread of respiratory viruses when an individual is contaminated by the airborne/droplet route or after uptake via the mouth (such as when touching the mouth or food with contaminated hands).

167,2970519,"We employed a cDNA microarray to analyze the patterns of the global gene expression of 2B4 cells in response to SARS-CoV, as the first step to explore the likely antiviral signaling pathway/s. To ascribe unique properties of SARS-CoV-induced innate responses (if any), it would be ideal to compare to those elicited by another strain of human coronavirus (HCoV), e.g., 229E and OC43. Unfortunately, neither HCoV-229E nor -OC43 could productively infect Calu-3 cells (data not shown), making such a comparison unlikely. Because DHOV, a proposed orthomyxoviral surrogate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus [45, 46] , productively infected 2B4 cells, resulting in highly intense secretion of Type I IFN and other innate inflammatory mediators (Hill et al., unpublished data), we compared the global gene expression of 2B4 cells in response to SARS-CoV versus DHOV. While the microarray-based analysis of the temporal gene expression of 2B4 cells in response to SARS-CoV or DHOV infection has been performed simultaneously within the same experimental setting, most of the results relevant to DHOV infection, unless indicated otherwise, are the subject of a separate manuscript (Hill et al. in preparation). More specifically, we were particularly interested in comparing virally induced genes that are either encoding for or relevant to the expression of IFN and other inflammatory cytokines as SARS pathogenesis has been proposed to stem from the combination of barely detectable, if any, IFN and exacerbated cytokine responses in patients severely affected by SARS-CoV infection [14, 47] ."

169,2526999,"QXIBV was first described and identified in China [28] , after that this IBV genotype spread and became one of the most prominent genotypes in many countries [29] [30] [31] . Although the complete S1 gene of the group II Thai IBV was of 95.5-96.0% nucleotide identity to Chinese QXIBV, the nucleotide sequences at 3 0 -terminus near the cleavage recognition site were different from the Chinese QXIBV. We found that this region was closely related to the Chinese isolate JX/99/01. Interestingly, this change was not found when the comparisons of the S1 gene among QXIBV reported in others countries were analyzed (data not shown). These findings suggest that the group II Thai IBV had gone through evident evolution change in Thailand. The isolates in the group III were clustered into the Massachusetts type. The Massachusetts type was also isolated in many countries world-wide including Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea [24] . Some of the Massachusetts type isolated here may be a field challenge which comes from the point mutation of vaccine strains because they had 97.5-99.9% nucleotide and 93.2-99.7% amino acid identity to the vaccine strains (data not shown). It has been shown that the S1 gene of the 4/91 pathogenic virus differs only 0.6% from the vaccine strain but it cannot conclude that the small number of sequence differences are responsible for the attenuation of pathogenicity [32] . However, the possibility that some of them were re-isolation of vaccine strains could not be excluded due to the 100% identity with the Massachusetts type, the vaccine strain used in Thailand. As indicated in the previous report, we could not conclusively distinguish between the vaccine strain and field challenge of the same genotype, especially when a sequence identity of between 99 and 100% was found [33] ."
170,921275,"Our survey showed that 72 (15.1%) out of 477 faecal samples that tested negative for PEDV-, TGEV-and other enteric viruses-specific RNA obtained from diarrhoeic pigs in several prefectures in Japan from 2013 to 2014 were positive for PDCoV-specific RNA. This detection rate of PDCoV-positive samples is similar to that (22%) observed in a survey of porcine samples collected in the U.S. in January-February 2014 (Marthaler et al., 2014b) . Because we have no detailed information of swine herds which collected diarrhoeic samples, our data cannot deny Infection, Genetics and Evolution 61 (2018) 176-182 the possibility that these diarrhoeas might be caused by other pathogens (bacteria and parasites), but suggests that PDCoV would associated with these diarrhoeas. Moreover, our data also suggests that PDCoV can infect into all age groups as similar as PEDV (Saif et al., 2012) . Particularly, our survey revealed the highest positive detection rates of PDCoV in sows. Because pregnant pigs are stressful, and decrease selfimmunity, sows are susceptible to pathogens around them. In fact, the report for first detection of PDCoV in U.S. exhibited that the U.S. PDCoVs were detected from sows with watery diarrhoea (Wang et al., 2014a (Wang et al., , 2014b . In field observation, it reports that sows showed not only severe diarrhoea but also vomiting and anorexia (in our personal communication). These findings suggest that PDCoV might be susceptible to older pig than piglets. However, its hypothesis would need to examine clinical signs and dynamics of viral distribution in older pigs experimentally inoculated with PDCoV in future."
171,2473264,"We are at risk for airborne transmission of zoonoses by many factors (e.g., from travel to farms, consumption of food, and mowing the lawn, which as been associated with tularemia). Visiting petting farms or having family pets increases the likelihood of potential zoonotic infections, especially if pets are exotic. Water sports may increase the risk for acquiring leptospirosis. Wilderness camping activities have been associated with hantavirus infection after inhalation of aerosolized urine excretions of rodents. Other sporting activities such as hunting have been associated with brucellosis and tularemia. Travel to other countries opens a range of new potential zoonotic exposures through direct contact or indirectly through fomites, food, or arthropod vectors. Increasingly exotic locations are being sought with associated exotic zoonoses. Some tourists consume local delicacies, such as aborted animal fetuses in Ecuador, which are a source of brucellosis (39) ."
172,175264,"Health professionals, especially those working in hospitals caring for people with confirmed or suspected 2019-nCoV pneumonia, are vulnerable to both high risk of infection and mental health problems. They may also experience fear of contagion and spreading the virus to their families, friends, or colleagues. Health workers in a Beijing hospital who were quarantined, worked in high-risk clinical settings such as SARS units, or had family or friends who were infected with SARS, had substantially more post-traumatic stress symptoms than those without these experiences. 8 Health professionals who worked in SARS units and hospitals during the SARS outbreak also reported depression, anxiety, fear, and frustration. 6 Despite the common mental health problems and disorders found among patients and health workers in such settings, most health professionals working in isolation units and hospitals do not receive any training in providing mental health care. Timely mental health care needs to be developed urgently. Some methods used in the SARS outbreak could be helpful for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. First, multidisciplinary mental health teams established by health authorities at regional and national levels (including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, and other mental health workers) should deliver mental health support to patients and health workers. Specialised psychiatric treatments and appropriate mental health services and facilities should be provided for patients with comorbid mental disorders. Second, clear communication with regular and accurate updates about the 2019-nCoV outbreak should be provided to both health workers and patients in order to address their sense of uncertainty and fear. Treatment plans, progress reports, and health status updates should be given to both patients and their families. Third, secure services should be set up to provide psychological counselling using electronic devices and applications (such as smartphones and WeChat) for affected patients, as well as their families and members of the public. Using safe communication channels between patients and families, such as smartphone communication and WeChat, should be encouraged to decrease isolation. Fourth, suspected and diagnosed patients with 2019-nCoV pneumonia as well as health professionals working in hospitals caring for infected patients should receive regular clinical screening for depression, anxiety, and suicidality by mental health workers. Timely psychiatric treatments should be provided for those presenting with more severe mental health problems. For most patients and health workers, emotional and behavioural responses are part of an adaptive response to extraordinary stress, and psychotherapy techniques such as those based on the stress-adaptation model might be helpful. 7, 10 If psychotropic medications are used, such as those prescribed by psychiatrists for severe psychiatric comorbidities, 6 basic pharmacological treatment principles of ensuring minimum harm should be followed to reduce harmful effects of any interactions with 2019-nCoV and its treatments."
173,544621,"Social distancing has been effective in past disease epidemics, curbing humantohuman transmission and reducing morbidity and mortality. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] A single social distancing policy can cut epidemic spread, but usually multiple such policies-including more restrictive mea sures such as isolation and quarantine-are implemented in combination to boost effectiveness. For example, during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, the New York City Department of Health enforced several social distancing policies at the same time, including staggered business hours, compulsory isolation, and quarantine, which likely led to New York City suffering the lowest death rate from influenza on the eastern seaboard of the USA. 17 During the current outbreak of COVID19, government officials and researchers were concerned that the mass movement of people at the end of the Lunar New Year holiday on Jan 31, 2020, would exacerbate the spread of COVID19 across China. Moreover, individuals typically return from their Lunar New Year holiday after only 1 week, which is shorter than the longest suspected incubation period of the disease. 18 Many of the 5 million people who left Wuhan before the travel ban was put into place 3 could still have been latently infected when their holiday ended. This situation, together with the resumed travel activities, would make it difficult to contain the outbreak."
174,1630249,"We detected pathogens in ∼30% of the control subjects. This percentage is considerably higher for the youngest age groups: viruses were detected in 68% and 40% of the control subjects aged 0-4 and 5-14 years, respectively. To our knowledge, only 2 other studies have investigated respiratory pathogens in persons without an ARTI [15, 32] . Johnston et al. [32] reported that 12% and 4% of asymptomatic children and adults, respectively, tested positive for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Graat et al. [15] reported that 4% of persons aged у60 years who did not have respiratory complaints tested positive for rhinoviruses and coronaviruses. Frequencies of subclinical respiratory infections in these studies were substantial lower than were those observed in our study: 68%, 55%, and 51% for asymptomatic children (age, 0-15 years), adults, and persons aged у65 years, respectively; this is probably because our study covered a wider range of pathogens. However, the percentage of subclinical infections in our study might have been overestimated, because we did not observe the control subjects for the subsequent development of symptoms. Although control subjects had no respiratory complaints before or at the moment that the nose/throat swabs were obtained, we cannot rule out the possibility that they were in the incubation period for an ARTI. From a questionnaire completed by case patients and control subjects, we know that the rates of exposure to persons with respiratory symptoms within or outside the household were 38% and 56%, respectively, for case patients and 24% and 30%, respectively, for control subjects. Graat et al. [15] included a follow-up period of 8 weeks and excluded only 8% of the control subjects because they developed respiratory symptoms. So, even if ∼10% of our control subjects would have had cases in the incubation period, we still found a substantial number of subclinical infections. For 1 of the 3 control subjects for whom influenza virus was detected, the GP reported that this child did not develop respiratory complaints in the 4 weeks after the nose/throat swab was taken."
175,461515,"Given that chondrocytes are pivotal in the synthesis, composition modulation, structural arrangement of ECM components and hence the mechanical properties, we developed a protocol for baculovirus transduction of rat (Ho et al., 2004) and rabbit chondrocytes. This protocol involves the incubation of cells with the virus at 25-27°C for 4-8 h using Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) as the surrounding solution and confers efficiencies higher than 90% . The key to such high transduction efficiencies is the absence of NaHCO 3 in D-PBS, which hinders the baculovirus transduction (Shen et al., 2007) . Consequently, the surrounding solution has been replaced with NaHCO 3 -deficient DMEM medium . Critically, chondrocytes transduced with an EGFP-expressing baculovirus remain capable of producing cartilage-specific collagen II and GAGs, and grow into cartilaginous tissues when seeded into the porous, poly (L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) scaffold and cultivated dynamically . These data demonstrate that baculovirus transduction of chondrocytes does not obstruct the chondrocytes differentiation. Therefore, we further constructed 3 baculovirus vectors each expressing one growth factor (TGF-β1, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) or bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)) known to stimulate chondrogenesis, and confirmed the protein expression in chondrocytes isolated from New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits . Among the 3 baculovirus vectors, only the BMP-2-expressing baculovirus (designated Bac-CB) remarkably enhanced the aggrecan and collagen II production by partially de-differentiated passage 3 (P3) cells and restored the differentiation. The baculovirus expressing TGF-β1 (designated Bac-CT) modestly augmented the chondrogenesis but was insufficient to reverse the de-differentiation status of P3 cells . Nonetheless, co-transduction of de-differentiated P3 chondrocytes with Bac-CB and Bac-CT synergistically modulated the re-differentiation program (Sung et al., 2009) ."
176,3143214,"In December 2019, COVID-19 epidemic was described in Wuhan, China, and the infection has spread widely affecting hundreds of thousands. Herein, an effort was made to identify commercially available drugs in order to repurpose them against coronavirus by the means of structure-based virtual screening. In addition, ZINC15 library was used to identify novel leads against main proteases. Human TMPRSS2 3D structure was first generated using homology modeling approach. Our molecular docking study showed four potential inhibitors against Mpro enzyme, two available drugs (Talampicillin and Lurasidone) and two novel drug-like compounds (ZINC000000702323 and ZINC000012481889). Moreover, four promising inhibitors were identified against TMPRSS2; Rubitecan and Loprazolam drugs, and compounds ZINC000015988935 and ZINC000103558522. ADMET profile showed that the hits from our study are safe and drug-like compounds. Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation using the MM-PBSA method was performed to calculate the interaction energy of the top-ranked drugs."
177,2594946,"We have since upgraded our PPE to disposable surgical gowns or coveralls (Kleenguard TM A60; Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, GA, USA) of at least an AAMI level-3 protection consistent with US Food and Drug Administration recommendations for moderate to highly invasive procedures. 1 We have also included neck protection in the form of either a coverall, or if a surgical gown is worn, a surgical hood with tie neck (priMed Medical Products Inc., Edmonton, AB, Canada) ( Figure B) . We now use high-cuff (9-12 cm) gloves, either non-sterile nitrile gloves or surgical gloves, and double glove. Neck contamination was almost eliminated after this change. Hand and forearm contamination was reduced by encouraging removal of rings and a full 20 sec surgical scrub style of cleaning with an alcohol-based hand rub at each step of the doffing process. Shoe and lower leg contamination was reduced by using the coverall with booties. We also have a surgical gown with knee-high booties as an alternative. Above all, it made practitioners aware that, despite meticulous donning and doffing, contamination is still highly possible and that a shower after an aerosol-generating medical procedure is very prudent."
178,3090732,"The potential infectiousness of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases together with a substantial fraction of asymptomatic infections among all infections, have been highlighted in clinical studies. We conducted statistical modeling analysis to derive the delay-adjusted asymptomatic proportion of the positive COVID-19 infections onboard the Princess Cruises ship along with the timeline of infections. We estimated the asymptomatic proportion at 17.9% (95% CrI: 15.5%-20.2%), with most of the infections occurring before the start of the 2-week quarantine."
179,504811,"In an early effort, Li et al. have implemented the COVNet to classify COVID-19 from community acquired pneumonia (CAP), which includes pneumonia caused by other germs, in CT scans [23] . Other researchers have also tried to tackle the same problem using CT images, reaching high scoring metrics and precise abnormality localization [24, 25] . Contrarily, even though many studies have claimed to reach excellent classification accuracy scores using CXRs [26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] , none of them have reported visualization results for their model decisions. Considering the fact that pneumonia diagnosis is more challenging in CXRs in comparison with CT scans and the available COVID-19 pneumonia CXR datasets are small, we investigate those studies with visual interpretability as it could be considered as a stronger performance metric."
180,3084229,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which emerged in the United States in 2013, has spread throughout North America. Limited availability of PEDV complete genomes worldwide has impeded our understanding of PEDV introduction into the United States. To determine the relationship between the North American strains and global emerging and historic PEDV strains, we sequenced and analyzed complete genomes of 74 strains from North America; the strains clustered into 2 distinct clades. Compared with the initially reported virulent US PEDV strains, 7 (9.7%) strains from 4 states contained insertions and deletions in the spike gene (S INDELs). These S INDEL strains share 99.8%-100% nt identity with each other and 96.2%-96.7% nt identity with the initial US strains. Furthermore, the S IN-DEL strains form a distinct cluster within North American clade II, sharing 98.6%-100% nt identity overall. In the United States, the S INDEL and original PEDV strains are cocirculating and could have been introduced simultaneously."
181,1630564,"We also found a high detection rate of bacterial pathogens. S. pneumoniae (56 %) and Hib (12 %) were the most common bacteria detected in nasopharyngeal specimens. Elevated colonization rates of these bacteria have been reported in children, but only a proportion of colonizations result in invasive disease [9, 11, 37] . The high detection rate of S. pneumoniae in our study is likely due to the fact that S. pneumoniae is a commensal of the nasopharynx [38] . It has been shown that the prevalence of S. pneumoniae carriage in healthy children <5 years of age ranges from 20 % to 93 % in low income countries [11] . The detection of S. pneumoniae from sterile sites like blood or cerebrospinal fluid, reflecting invasive pneumococcal disease, has been shown to be lower (5-9 %) [8, 39] . Nonetheless, S. pneumoniae has been reported to be responsible for 12 % of meningitis cases in Niger based on cerebrospinal fluid testing; 26 different serotypes were detected among cases of meningitis prior to the introduction of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in 2014 [40] . Hib and S. aureus, the 2 nd and 3 rd most prevalent bacterial pathogens in our study, have also been shown to be commensal organisms with high nasopharyngeal carriage rates especially in young children [11] . The substantial Hib nasopharyngeal colonization density found in this study should be investigated further as Hib vaccine has been available in the Niger expanded immunization program since 2008. Nasopharyngeal specimens may be used to aid in the diagnosis of certain bacterial respiratory pathogens that do not tend to colonize the nasopharynx, such as M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae [38, 41] . C. pneumoniae was detected at low rates (2.5 %), and M. pneumoniae was not detected in our study. Using serological methods, prevalence rates as high as 30 % have been reported for C. pneumoniae [9] ; in contrast, other studies report significant detection of M. pneumoniae (>10 %) and low detection of C. pneumoniae (<1 %) [12, 26, 42] ."
182,460057,"Bacterial systems are often included the commercial E.coli strains and expression vectors, to produce non-enveloped VLPs in high levels compared to other systems (Table I) . 5 In addition, bacterial cells have been applied for generation of VLPs which need several types of structural proteins, such as the avibirnavirus IBDV VP2, VP4, and VP3-polyproteins. 54 The reports indicated that the expression of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid protein in E. coli leads to the formation of structures similar to the HBV core (HBc) particle. 55 Bacterial FIGURE 1 General model of VLP along with its applications: The picture shows the recombinant HPV16 L1 pentamers assembled in vitro into capsid-like structures. Self-assembly of recombinant viral coat proteins into empty capsids is a promising strategy for production of virus-like particles (VLPs) in vaccine design. The resulting VLPs can induce a protective immune response by mimicking the authentic epitopes of virions. systems are not always a desired plan for VLP production due to several factors, such as (a) lack of ability to generate recombinant proteins with mammalian-like post-translational modifications (PTM), (b) failure to produce the correct disulfide bonds, (c) drawbacks of protein solubility, and d) the existence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/or endotoxins in production of recombinant proteins (rp). 5 Viral coat proteins (CPs) can be efficiently produced as insoluble inclusion bodies, purified under denaturing conditions, refolded, and selfassembled, as indicated in the parvovirus B19 and the CCMV and CMV plant viruses. 56 A simple change in the cultivation conditions such as low-temperature can solve the problem of inclusion bodies and induce the formation of soluble VLPs, as performed for two viral systems, the densovirus IHHNV, 57 and the potyvirus PVY. 58 Some factors including the resistance markers of the expression plasmids and the composition of the cultivation medium can also change the VLP assembly (e.g., bacteriophage Qb). 59 Another strategy applied to increase expression levels and solubility involves the use of different fusion protein systems, e.g., glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins such as the papillomavirus L1, the polyomavirus MuPyV, and the picornavirus FMDV. [60] [61] [62] [63] Other prokaryotic hosts have been recently used to generate VLP, e.g., Lactobacillus. 8 The intracellular assembly of HPV16 L1 VLP was reported in Lactobacillus casei, a lactose-inducible expression strain. 5 Furthermore, the production of L1 VLPs using Lactobacillus developed new live mucosal prophylactic vaccines (Table  I) . 29, 30 A Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens) expression system is an efficient choice against E. coli, because of simple manipulation, high yields of active and soluble proteins, and largescale cultivation. Some differences between P. fluorescens and E. coli including the various sizes of genome, and diverse metabolic approaches can influence the generation of recombinant proteins. 64 The capsid protein of a plant bromovirus, the cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV), has been recently expressed as a soluble form in P. fluorescens, and assembled into VLPs in vivo. This construct was structurally similar to the natural viral particles provided from plants. 64 "
183,454650,"The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is the second novel zoonotic disease infecting humans caused by coronavirus (CoV) in this century. To date, more than 2200 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been identified in 27 countries, and more than 800 MERS-CoV associated deaths have been reported since its outbreak in 2012 [1] . Rapid laboratory diagnosis of MERS-CoV is the key to successful containment and prevention of the spread. Nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT, e.g., real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction [real-time RT-qPCR]), virus isolation, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and serological methods (e.g., antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and immunofluorescence assay [IFA] ) have been developed and used for MERS-CoV diagnosis [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . While the ""gold standard"" for MERS-CoV diagnosis is NAAT of the upper region of the envelope gene (up-E) or the nucleocapsid (N) gene as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), antigen capture ELISA assay for MERS-CoV can also be informative when NAAT is not available or when the serological assay is used to confirm the findings and aid treatment decision [2, 3] ."

The sequences of miRNAs are highly conserved among plants-microorganisms-animals, suggesting that miRNAs represent a relatively old and important regulatory pathway [7] . MiRNAs belong to the most abundant class of human gene regulators [8] : up to a third of the human genes are regulated by miRNAs [9] . MiRNAs are, therefore, key regulators of numerous genes in biological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis [e.g. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] ].

185,1983530,"Identification of various factors that affect the spreading rate of the novel coronavirus dramatically helps to control the outbreak. This way, from the advent of this disease, several studies have been done to provide accurate information for implementing disease outbreak responses. Tang et al.

[11] analyzed data in Wuhan and determined the epidemiologic, and they found out that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days. By taking to account the impact of the variations in the disease, Zhao et al. [12] modeled the epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, reporting. A Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model has been developed by Chen et al. [13, 14] to simulate the potential transmission from the infectious sources to human. Wang et al. [15] formulated a complex network model, and then based on their model, they analyzed the possible time node and the risk impact of resumption on the secondary outbreak in Wuhan and surrounding areas.

186,1983651,"Available data, although limited, suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is relatively rare and less severe compared to that in adults 4, 5 . However, a recent study pointed out that children are just as likely to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 as adults when exposed to similar environment. Among all children under 10 who had close contact with confirmed cases, the infection rate was 7.4%, which is comparable to that of the whole population average (7.9%) 6 . The latest guidelines also state that all individuals, including children, are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 7 . In the meantime, the low incidence of critical illness in children has been reported repeatedly and accepted widely while the underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated."

Children with respiratory infections are generally treated as outpatients and the etiology of their disease is not investigated. If they are hospitalized, the commonly employed evaluation techniques are often not sufficiently sensitive. 3 Experience and understanding of the role of viral coinfections in respiratory infections has grown in recent years, thanks to the introduction of molecular techniques. [4] [5] [6] At present, the clinical data available on coinfection, in terms of both the number of viruses involved and the severity of the condition, are variable and even, at times, contradictory.

These results had been obtained in Vero cells (or its E6 subclone), in which ribavirin is known to be of low antiviral activity, most probably because of insufficient phosphorylation to its active triphosphorylated form. More recent studies showed that ribavirin inhibits SARS-CoV replication in fRHK-4 cells at concentrations of about 50 lg/ml [5, 6] . These findings suggest that multiple cell culture systems should be used to evaluate the activity of antiviral agents against emerging viruses such as SARS-CoV."

192,410003,"We previously hypothesized that SCV infects type 1 pneumocytes, based on the character of the pulmonary lesions in experimentally infected macaques and the known tropism of other respiratory coronaviruses for type 1 pneumocytes 2 . We found extensive type 2 pneumo-cyte hyperplasia in the lungs of SCV-infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., suggesting that there had been loss of type 1 pneumocytes at an earlier stage of infection 2,12 . To determine whether type 1 pneumocytes are infected by SCV at an earlier stage of infection, we conducted pathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the lungs of four SCV-infected macaques (control group) at 4 d.p.i.. The lungs had multifocal, acute DAD, which was characterized by flooding of alveoli with protein-rich edema fluid mixed with neutrophils and rare syncytia, extensive loss of alveolar and bronchiolar epithelium, and occasional type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia ( Fig. 1a; for comparison, normal alveolar morphology is seen in Fig. 1b) . Immunohistochemistry revealed extensive SCV antigen expression by squamous cells lining the alveolar walls (Fig. 1c,d; compare with Fig. 1e) . These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes by their location, morphology and expression of keratin in serial sections. Transmission electron microscopy of alveolar cells revealed coronaviruslike particles measuring about 70 nm in diameter with typical internal nucleocapsid-like structure (Fig. 1f,g) . These cells were identified as type 1 pneumocytes because they lined the alveolar lumen, were closely apposed to the basement membrane, were squamous, contained abundant pinocytotic vesicles, and-in contrast to type 2 pneumocytes-had neither lamellar bodies nor microvilli 13 . As found previously in experimentally infected macaques at 6 d.p.i., less extensive SCV antigen expression also was detected in hyperplastic type 2 pneumocytes within inflammatory foci 2 (Fig. 1h) . Together, these histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings show that type 1 pneumocytes are the main target of SCV in early infection, and are associated with DAD."

194,3077748,"The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has already taken on pandemic proportions, affecting over 100 countries in a matter of weeks. A global response to prepare health systems worldwide is imperative. Although containment measures in China have reduced new cases by more than 90%, this reduction is not the case elsewhere, and Italy has been particularly affected. There is now grave concern regarding the Italian national health system's capacity to effectively respond to the needs of patients who are infected and require intensive care for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. The percentage of patients in intensive care reported daily in Italy between March 1 and March 11, 2020, has consistently been between 9% and 11% of patients who are actively infected. The number of patients infected since Feb 21 in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. If this trend continues for 1 more week, there will be 30 000 infected patients. Intensive care units will then be at maximum capacity; up to 4000 hospital beds will be needed by mid-April, 2020. Our analysis might help political leaders and health authorities to allocate enough resources, including personnel, beds, and intensive care facilities, to manage the situation in the next few days and weeks. If the Italian outbreak follows a similar trend as in Hubei province, China, the number of newly infected patients could start to decrease within 3-4 days, departing from the exponential trend. However, this cannot currently be predicted because of differences between social distancing measures and the capacity to quickly build dedicated facilities in China."
195,920315,"Chloroquine (CQ) is currently being investigated extensively for its promising activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection [96, 97] . CQ is an old antimalarial drug with limited use due to its resistance as well as poisoning risk (rhythm disturbance, QT interval prolongation) [98] . The derivative hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was developed later and showed better clinical safety and lower risks of toxicities [99] . HCQ is also an option for the management of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus. HCQ is a highly available drug with a low cost and an acceptable toxicity profile [80] . Moreover, HCQ has good oral bioavailability allowing it to reach significant blood concentration that is sufficient to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. These properties nominate HCQ as a great candidate to be applied on large scale use such as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. On the in vitro level, HCQ showed significant inhibition of the SAR-CoV-2 infection [46] . CQ and HCQ resulted in significant antiviral cytotoxicity in African green monkey kidney VeroE6 cells (ATCC-1586) (CC 50 273.20 and 249.50 μM, respectively). The two compounds reduced the viral RNA copy number, with CQ being significantly more potent [100] . Another in vitro study has shown the potency of CQ and HCQ against SARS-CoV-2 with HCQ with enhanced potency (EC 50 = 0.72% μM vs 5.47% μM) [101] . Suggested mechanisms of action include interfering with the pH-dependent steps of viral replication by increasing the pH of intracellular vesicles such as lysosomes and endosomes [96] . CQ also blocks the ACE2 receptor glycosylation and thus prevents the S protein binding [102] . Wang et al. have demonstrated potent blocking of SARS-COV-2 viral infection by CQ (EC 50 = 1.13 μM; CC 50 >100 μM, SI >88.50) [84] . CQ and HCQ also have immunomodulatory effects that might help in reversing the hyperinflammation and cytokine storm associated with SARS-COV-2 pneumonia [102] ."
196,1717052,"Bioaerosol studies have demonstrated that concentrations of airborne bacteria in underground subway systems tend to fluctuate seasonally and are linked to human presence and activities 20, 21 . Such information demonstrates the possible role of public transportation in disease transmission, but again, only few studies have focused on the existence of airborne viruses in public transportation systems [22] [23] [24] [25] . Mathematical models have been developed to assess the risk of airborne and droplet transmission of respiratory viruses in buses, airline cabins and cities [26] [27] [28] , and although these simulation data are useful, we have sparse field data to support them. In this study, we sought to monitor for respiratory viruses in Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) network, a likely area of virus incursion as well as a pathway for virus transmission. Specifically, we asked, could noninvasive bioaerosol sampling detect respiratory viruses in Singapore's MRT network?"
197,702415,"For many years, the greatest concerns about blood safety were focused upon viral infections, most notably hepatitides and retroviral diseases. As a result of experience with these infections, it was widely anticipated that future transfusiontransmissible infections would result from viruses causing persistent infection, most probably parenterally transmitted. However, until around the year 2000, most effort relating to emerging infections was directed towards parasitic diseases. Attention was refocused on viral infections as a result of the outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) disease in the USA along with the recognition that it was transmissible by transfusion [1] . This paper will briefly review currently emerging viruses other than WNV, which have been shown to be, or which have the potential to be transmitted by transfusion. Specifically omitted are CMV, EBV, hepatitis A virus and the B19 erythrovirus, which are demonstrably transmitted by transfusion, but which do not fit the current definition of emerging agents."

199,896726,"Various viral agents including coronavirus, parvovirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus and vesiviruses (feline calicivirus, FCV) have been identified in the stools of cats, although there is limited information on their role as enteric pathogens [10] [11] [12] [13] . Small round structured viruses (SRSVs) have been detected occasionally in the feces of cats by using electron microscopy (EM) and have been mostly characterized as FCV [12, 14] . Interestingly, Norwalk-like 27-nm virus particles, clearly distinguishable from FCVs, were detected from an outbreak of vomiting and diarrhea in adult cats in Germany in 1987, although the viruses were neither adapted to cultivation in vitro nor characterized further [15] . More recently, antibodies specific for the baculovirus-expressed VP1 of Lion/NoV/Pistoia-387/ 06/IT were detected in the sera of cats by ELISA. These previous findings suggest that NoVs infect cats [16] ."
200,1060233,"In China, PED was firstly occurred in Shanghai in 1973. So far, PEDV has been observed on most swine breeding farms in most provinces since late 2010 in China [5] .The economic losses caused by PEDV infection have been continuous and serious in China [6] . Recently, PEDV has suddenly emerged in the United States and rapidly spread across the country, resulting in high mortality in infected newborn piglets, which have posed serious economic losses to the swine industry in the USA [7, 8] . Rapid diagnosis and timely monitoring of potential PED outbreaks are among the first important steps in the prevention and control of PED. Currently, several conventional methods are available for the detection of PEDV, including virus isolation, fluorescence assay, immune electron microscopy, enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay and molecular biological characterization [9] . However, the isolation and identification of viruses require extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks; so this method does not meet the time requirements needed for the prevention of epidemics. Therefore, these rapid, sensitive and specific molecular biological techniques, including RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, have played important roles in the rapid detection of PEDV [10] . Nevertheless, all of these techniques require sophisticated instrumentation (such as PCR machines and quantitative fluorescence PCR machines), limiting the effectiveness of these procedures in smaller, under-equipped laboratories."
201,1173298,"Our study systematically tested all adult patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms during peak weeks of the influenza season and found at least 1 virus in 46% in 2011-2012 and in 62% in 2012-2013. The contribution of ORV relative to influenza hospitalizations varied by year and age group. Comparable or fewer adult patients hospitalized with respiratory illness during the peak influenza period of 2011-2012 were diagnosed with influenza (n = 62) vs an ORV (n = 72), whereas influenza (8) 18 (6) 1 (1) 25 (8) The important role of ORVs relative to influenza observed in our study is in line with other studies with prospective testing [11, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] 30] or with indirect estimation [3, 4, 28] of hospitalized adults. As in our study, the most frequently detected respiratory viruses in studies testing for multiple viruses by molecular multiplex assays during winter seasons (mostly from November to May) were influenza (6%-9%) [11, 23, 31] , RSV (5%-7%) [11, 23, 31] , hMPV (4%-6%) [11, 23, 31] , coronaviruses (7%) [31] , rhinoviruses (4%) [31] , and hPIV (2%) [31] . In studies encompassing all year, these proportions were somewhat lower for influenza (2%-9%) [24] [25] [26] 30] , RSV (1.5%-3%) [23, 25, 26, 30] , hMPV (0.7%-4%) [23, 25, 26, 30] , and coronaviruses (2%-6%) [24] [25] [26] 30] , whereas for hPIV and rhinoviruses that may circulate throughout the year, proportions were similar (hPIV, 1%-3% [25, 26, 30] ) or even higher (rhinoviruses, 2%-33% [24] [25] [26] 30] ). Not surprisingly, we detected a higher proportion of patients with influenza because our study was concentrated on peak influenza weeks. However, even during the 10 peak weeks of the 2011-2012 season, more adult patients were hospitalized with ORV (n = 72) than with influenza (n = 62)."
202,1315050,"As the capital city of China, Beijing covers an area of 16,800 km 2 with a large population of more than 19.72 million (Chinese Statistics Bureau, 2011). In order to elucidate the spectrum of the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections and provide basic data to guide local disease prevention and control measures, a sentinel surveillance project on the viral aetiology of acute respiratory infections was initiated and sponsored by the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau in 2011. Adenovirus is one of the most common causes of viral acute respiratory infections. In this study, our primary aim was to identify the types of HAdV causing respiratory illness in Beijing since 2011, to avoid the overuse of antibiotics and to improve the level of diagnosis and treatment of respiratory viral disease especially HAdV associated disease in hospitals, and to provide scientific basis for prevention and control of HAdV causing respiratory illness."
203,2390331,"The approach to single vaccine injection with ADV vectors is relevant to the containment and treatment of Ebola virus and related outbreaks that are continuing to emerge in central Africa 12 . Should this vaccine approach prove effective in humans, our finding raises the possibility that ring vaccination could be used to contain outbreaks, similar to smallpox in the past. This result also suggests alternative strategies for vaccination against Ebola or other acute pathogenic diseases. The prime-boost strategy remains more immunologically potent and, if the response is highly durable, may still be useful for preventative vaccines, for example, in hospital workers. In contrast, the single adenoviral vaccine administration may be better used during acute outbreaks. It is also possible that alternative viral vectors, such as those derived from other adenovirus serotypes or from poxvirus vectors, might be used to boost an ADV type 5 vector primary immunization. Alternative ADV serotypes will also help to overcome immunity to natural ADV type 5 infection that could potentially reduce vaccine efficacy in some populations. A one-shot vaccine may be helpful in the control of Ebola virus outbreaks in great ape populations of central Africa 13 . Analogous single-dose ADV vector immunization could also be used for other emerging and highly lethal infectious pathogens, such as Marburg, Lassa or the SARS coronavirus."
204,1063814,"Glucocorticoids have both stimulating and inhibitory effects on the immune response. In the initial phases of an infection, physiological glucocorticoid concentrations help to prime the immune system. In turn, this response activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis to mild immunosuppression to reduce autoimmunity and cytokine toxicity. In critical illness (eg, COVID-19 pneumonia), HPA activation might be blunted, leading to corticosteroid insufficiency related to critical illness. 2 The rationale for use of glucocorticoids in lung damage lies in their ability to reduce inflammation and, ideally, fibrosis. However, the absence of benefit on overall survival has discouraged their use 3 to the point that WHO guidance on management of COVID-19 advises against corticosteroids, unless indicated for other reasons. 4 Adrenal insufficiency is one of those reasons and standard care suggests to apply the so-called sick day rules when COVID-19 is suspected. 5 Patients with adrenal insufficiency have an increased risk of infection due to their depleted innate immunity, characterised by increased monocytes and decreased cytotoxic natural killer cells, 6 which could facilitate the worsening of a SARS-CoV-2 infection into severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Given the role of the HPA axis in stress priming the immune response, patients with adrenal insufficiency are intuitively at high risk of infection, especially as corticosteroid therapy during infection is still largely tailored empirically, often disregarding timing and dosage. The rationale of the more the better avoids risking inadequate concentrations of corticosteroids. However, mild COVID-19 symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and diarrhoea are common in patients with adrenal insufficiency, and patients' fears might lead them to increase their dose unnecessarily. Establishing the correct timing of stress dose administration relative to the degree of inflammatory damage and the desired effect on the immune system is crucial-ie, not too early, not too late."
205,1152157,"Many health workers, including endoscopists, nurses, healthcare workers and anaesthetists, work in endoscopy suites, with different types of procedures being performed daily. There is a certain risk of exposing staff to respiratory, oropharyngeal and faecal secretions. Furthermore, aggressive suctioning and multiple catheter exchange via endoscope working channels may expose staffs to splashes of secretion. 30 Microorganisms have been detected on the walls of endoscopy suite and postoperative recovery areas. 31 During the SARS epidemic, 21% of people affected were healthcare workers. 32 The grouping of many patients and healthcare workers at endoscopy can put them at risk of human to human transmission. For patients with COVID-19 who require endoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia, anaesthesis should be conducted by a designated team while other members of the endoscopy team should stay outside the room. The anaesthetic procedure should be performed with all healthcare providers in full PPE. 33 Biopsy samples obtained from the infected person can also be a source of infection as active viral replication was identified during the SARS pandemic in 2003. 8 Hence, all specimen from patients with COVID-19 should be handled with extra precaution and with appropriate protective equipment. Training should be provided for all staff for PPE gowning and downing. Figure 2 illustrates the typical PPE used in our unit in Hong Kong."
206,922436,"confirmed by the detection of viral material in biopsy specimens and stool, even in discharged patients [1, 4] . These data may partially provide explanations for the gastrointestinal symptoms and support the hypothesis of a faecal-oral transmission route of the infection [1, 4] . Therefore, given the wide range of reported incidences (3-79%) of gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain and gastrointestinal bleeding, gastroenterologists and endoscopists are directly involved in managing COVID-19 infections [1, 5, 6] . As this is a completely new disease, knowledge evolves rapidly day by day and dealing with this complex situation is challenging [7, 8] . With the increased need for intensive care units, European hospitals have started to markedly reduce elective activities and endoscopy, and the majority of resources were ed towards the COVID-19 pandemic [7] . These facts led to the resetting of clinical priorities and to a significant change of perspective [9] . Indeed, young gastroenterologists' (GI) training and clinical activity are moving from a model based on the concept of patient-centered care toward a concept of community-centered care. Understanding what fellows and young GIs know about COVID-19 and the changes in their daily activity aids to provide a comprehensive picture of the current situation and explores if it is possible to maintain A high-quality standard of training."

208,2035509,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA paramyxovirus that includes two major groups, A and B, each of which consists of 5 to 6 genotypes. The RSV genome encodes two nonstructural (NS1 and NS2) and nine structural proteins, including the F (fusion) and G (attachment) glycoproteins on the viral envelope. Antibodies against the F and G proteins are neutralizing, and have been shown to confer protection against RSV infection in animal models. Immunity after primary infection (which generally occurs by 2 years of age) is partial and short-lived; thus, reinfections can occur throughout life. 120 Low serum neutralizing antibody levels in adults predicts infection risk and disease severity. 121 Immunologic mechanisms (e.g. cytokine responses) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of severe RSV diseases; however, emerging evidence suggests that uncontrolled viral replication, as indicated by high respiratory tract viral load, drives disease manifestations and is associated with severe clinical outcomes. 120, [122] [123] [124] [125] Such findings provide an important rationale for the approach to antiviral drug development against RSV. 122 Epidemiology RSV is known to be an important cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children (e.g. acute bronchiolitis, wheezy attacks), resulting in hospitalizations and deaths. 126 In adults, it has been estimated that RSV infects 3-10% of the population Prevention There is no vaccine or chemoprophylaxis available for coronaviruses at present. 102 Droplet and contact precautions, including the use of face masks, are advisable to prevent transmission. As transmission could be opportunistically airborne, appropriate isolation precautions (in negative-pressure facilities if available) should be implemented in all hospitalized patients confirmed with novel coronavirus infections, particularly when respiratory procedures and devices are applied. [88] [89] [90] [91] Diagnostic Microbiology A high index of suspicion, together with detailed clinical and epidemiological assessments (e.g. travel history to affected areas, case clustering), is required for the diagnosis of novel coronavirus infections. 88, 103 RT-PCR is the diagnostic test of choice. A combination of upper respiratory (nasal, pharyngeal, nasopharyngeal), lower respiratory (higher yield due to higher viral levels, e.g. sputum, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) whenever available), blood and fecal samples, and repeated sampling should be considered to maximize the chance of virus detection. [103] [104] [105] A single negative test from an upper respiratory sample may be insufficient to rule out the diagnosis. For SARS-CoV, plasma RT-PCR can detect viremia as early as day 2-3 after symptom onset, and its level may have prognostic value. 88, 99 Virus culture (e.g. using Vero cells) is confirmatory, but the delay to a result prevents its use for clinical management; also biosafety level-3 facilities are required. Serological diagnosis is retrospective and largely used for epidemiological surveillance purposes. 103 Clinicians should refer to their local reference laboratories for coronavirus testing (e.g. pancoronavirus RT-PCR, specific SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RT-PCR). 87, 91 Clinical Manifestations"

Liver impairment has been reported in up to 60% of patients with SARS 3 and has also been reported in patients infected with MERS-CoV. 4 At least seven relatively large-scale case studies have reported the clinical features of patients with COVID-19. 1, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] In this Comment, we assess how the liver is affected using the available case studies and data from The Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital, Beijing, China. These data indicate that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver comorbidities and 14-53% cases reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) during disease progression (table) . Patients with severe COVID-19 seem to have higher rates of liver dysfunction. In a study in The Lancet by Huang and colleagues, 5 elevation of AST was observed in eight (62%) of 13 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with seven (25%) of 28 patients who did not require care in the ICU. Moreover, in a large cohort including 1099 patients from 552 hospitals in 31 provinces or provincial municipalities, more severe patients with disease had abnormal liver aminotransferase levels than did non-severe patients with disease. 1 Furthermore, in another study, 8 patients who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by CT scan while in the subclinical phase (ie, before symptom onset) had significantly lower incidence of AST abnormality than did patients diagnosed after the onset of symptoms. Therefore, liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases than in mild cases of COVID-19."

This study compared the positive percent agreement (PPA) of ID Now (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA) and Simplexa (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy) using a modified CDC method as the reference standard (1). All three methods are used as part of standard of care testing within our hospital system. Ninety-six remnant clinical specimens from April 2020 that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 using standard of care testing were selected based on convenience and retested using the three methods. Fourteen negative controls (universal transport medium [UTM]) were included to control for carryover contamination. Specimens included 11 supervised self-collected nasal swabs in 2 ml normal saline and 85 provider-collected nasopharyngeal swabs in 3 ml UTM. The online Medcalc tool (https://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php) was used to determine the exact Clopper-Pearson 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

212,1868085,"Quantitative fit testing (QNFT) is a recognized method to determine whether a tight-fitting respirator fits a wearer. This method adopts an electronic device to measure the ratio of particular air particles inside and outside the breathing zone (when donned with a respirator), and the ratio reflects the degree of leakage. 10 To make it simple, QNFT is ""an assessment of the adequacy of respirator fit by numerically measuring the amount of leakage into the respirator."" 10 To assess any possible leakage, most of the preset fit testing systems require the wearer with a donned N95 respirator to perform a series of exercises, including a static portion without body movement (ie, normal and deep breathing) and a dynamic portion with both normal breathing and designated movements (ie, side-to-side head movement, up and down head movement, talking or reading a standard set of passages, grimacing, bending over). These exercises simulate the common working activities in the clinical environment; hence, the results of QNFT can conservatively reflect any possible leakage. The characteristics of objective measurement and an automatic process increase the significance of QNFT, which now serves as the gold standard in worldwide guidelines and research literature. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Although QNFT warrants reliability of N95 respirator usage, any significant change in facial morphology, body weight, or donning method may contribute to on-site leakage. 10, 18, 19 Therefore, even if a given respirator is considered fit by the recognized fit testing, a user seal check is still suggested in order to check the appropriateness of every donning. 10, [20] [21] [22] A user seal check is a self-examination procedure for wearers of N95 respirators to identify on-site gross leakage through repeated visual checks on obvious gaps and positive and negative pressure checks on the seal. 10, 15, [20] [21] [22] N95 respirator manufacturers and some authorities recommend that this practice should be routinely carried out by frontline health care workers. 10, 20, 21 Previous experimental studies on U.S. subjects suggested that the user seal check improved the donning of N95 respirators. 23, 24 Although the scale of these studies was not large enough (N = 11 and N = 64), 23,24 the rigor of the experimental design and the use of repeated measurements increased the credibility of the results. Some guidelines suggest that no further fit testing is needed for a given respirator if subjective leakage is detected by a user seal check. This check may substitute for fit testing if fit testing is not available because of logistic difficulties or failure of the fit testing system. Several recent studies, nevertheless, have consistently rejected this suggestion of substitution. 12, 14, 15, 25 In Hong Kong, a retrospective study demonstrated that the user seal check failed in determining the fit of N95 respirators because its false-positive (19%-31%) and false-negative (24%-40%) rates were too high among 84 Chinese nursing staff. 12 Lam et al further supported the previously mentioned claim through 2 prospective studies on Chinese nursing students (N = 204 and N = 349, respectively) by presenting the sensitivity (15%-23%), specificity (89%-90%), positive (46%-63%) and negative (60%-67%) predictive values, and Kappa values (-0.031 to -0.047, P > .05) of the user seal check. 14, 15 In a Canadian study, similar results and conclusions were also reported on research involving 784 health care workers (false positive rate: 25%-30%). 25 The congruent results indicate that the user seal check cannot replace the fit testing. It is believed that the user seal check, which does not involve any dynamic body movement, is unlikely to mirror the fit testing results because the latter assessment is performed when the wearer performs 8 sequential exercises involving a series of head and body movement."

216,1337346,"Coronaviruses belong to the virus family Coronaviridae and are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses. The coronavirus genome is approximately 31 Kb, making these viruses the largest known RNA viruses [1, 2] . Coronaviruses infect a variety of host species, including humans and several other vertebrates. These viruses predominantly cause respiratory and intestinal tract infections and induce a wide range of clinical manifestations [3, 4] . Coronaviruses infecting the respiratory tract have long been recognized as significant pathogens in domestic and companion animals and as the cause of mild and severe respiratory illness in humans [4, 5] . In general, coronaviruses infecting humans can be classified into low pathogenic hCoVs, which include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU and highly pathogenic CoVs such as severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) [6, 7] . Low pathogenic hCoV infect upper airways and cause seasonal mild to moderate cold-like respiratory illnesses in healthy individuals. In contrast, the highly pathogenic hCoVs (pathogenic hCoV or hCoV hereafter) infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe pneumonia, which sometimes leads to fatal acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), resulting in high morbidity and mortality [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ."

The S gene encodes S protein which consists of two domains called S1 and S2 domain. The S1 domain plays an important role in binding to specific host cell receptors and contains a neutralizing epitope. The S2 domain functions in membrane fusion (Shang et al., 2018) . The E and M genes are transmembrane proteins associated with viral envelope formation and virus release (Woo et al., 2010) . On the other hand, the functions of the N gene are associated with viral RNA replication and pathogenesis (Lee & Lee, 2015) ."
220,1630257,"HMPV, which was originally isolated in the Netherlands 1 and is closely related to avian metapneumovirus, was the first human disease-causing pathogen identified in the genus metapneumovirus. 2 HMPV causes various clinical symptoms, such as cough, wheezing, and fever. 2 Young children and the elderly are more susceptible to HMPV infection. 2, 3 Indeed, HMPV mainly infects children under 5 years of age and causes upper respiratory tract and severe lower respiratory tract infections.

Later, two types of FCoVs were identified, one, which is confined to the digestive tract and does not spread beyond regional lymph nodes. This is the so-called feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). The second, immunologically closely related to FECV, is capable of going systemic by infecting monocytes and macrophages and causing FIP.

223,1628379,"In considering the limitations of the live attenuated and inactivated IBV vaccines, reverse genetic IBV vaccines have been developed in recent years as they display increased safety and efficacy [28] [29] [30] . As reverse genetic technology is primarily based on the H120 and Beaudette strains [31] [32] [33] , both of which are passagegenerated attenuated strains, the mechanism of virus virulence attenuation remains unclear, thereby posing difficulties in the development of attenuated vaccines using this technology. In addition to the function of host invasion and increasing genetic diversity, the IBV S1 subunit can induce virus neutralizing and cross-reactive antibodies [34] . Therefore, some researchers have created an attenuated IBV vaccine by replacing the S1 or S genes from other virulent strains using reverse genetic technology to generate protection against strains of the corresponding serotype [5, 28, 30] . In the present study, we constructed a recombinant strain, using the reverse genetic system. rH120-S1/YZ is based on the backbone of the vaccine strain H120, and the S1 gene was replaced with that of the QX-like nephropathogenic strain, ck/CH/IBYZ/2011, which was isolated in China. Our results demonstrate that this recombinant strain is safe and provides effective protection in young chickens against QX-like IBV challenge."

225,1407647,"Protein sequence alignment. Using the P. alecto genome Ensembl database, the amino acid sequence of major lymphocyte surface markers, cytokines and transcriptional factors was aligned with that of their human and mouse counterparts (Table 1) . Overall, the identity ranged from 44-95% with higher percentages systematically found between P. alecto and human compared to P. alecto and mouse (Table 1) . Furthermore, the amino acid sequence of intracellular molecules such as transcription factors Gata3, T-bet and Eomes was highly conserved between bats and human/mouse with sequence identity ranging from 88-95%, whereas it was lower for the surface markers (44-78%). High sequence identity was also found between bat TNF and IL-10, and their human counterparts (88 and 83%, respectively). Identification of the major lymphocyte cell populations using cross-reactive antibodies. To assess the cross reactivity of anti-human/mouse antibodies with bat ortholog proteins, we tested 47 commercially available antibodies (Table S1 ). Among which only 9 displayed cross-reactivity by flow cytometry with P. alecto lymphocytes. Interestingly, among these 9 cross-reactive antibodies, only 3 target surface molecules (MHCII,  CD44 and CD11b), whereas the remaining 6 target intracellular molecules including the intracellular domain  of CD3, transcription factors (T-bet, Gata-3 and Eomes), IL-10 and TNF cytokines (Table S1 ). This observation correlates well with the higher degree of sequence conservation between bats and human/mouse for intracellular molecules (Table 1) . It is worth to note that although the transcription factors Foxp3 and RORγ t, expressed by CD4 + T regulatory cells (Treg) and CD4 + Th17 cells respectively in human and mice, were also highly conserved in P. alecto, identification of cross-reactive antibodies against these molecules was unsuccessful. Importantly, an antibody targeting the cytoplasmic domain of human CD3 molecule, which has also been reported to be highly cross-reactive with CD3 from other mammals (Table S1) , cross-reacted with its bat counterpart, thus allowing identification of the T cell population in P. alecto. However, since human/mouse antibodies failed to detect the major lymphocyte surface markers CD4 and CD8 from bat lymphocytes, a strategy based on the expression of transcription factors was adopted to further characterize the T cell subsets. Human and mouse T cell subsets express different transcription factors upon differentiation into effector cells [24] [25] [26] . As such, Gata3 has been reported to be the master regulator driving the development of the CD4 + Th2 subset, whereas the CD4 + Th1 subset expresses predominantly Tbet. As for the CD8 + T cell population, co-expression of Tbet and Eomes was described, although Tbet is expressed at an earlier stage than Eomes during the development into effector cells and gets down-regulated later during memory formation 27, 28 . Based on the assumption that similar T cell subsets with similar expression pattern of transcription factors exist in bats, we devised the following flow cytometry strategy. Total bat splenocytes were first gated on live single cells, excluding doublets (Fig. 1a) . The total lymphocyte population was further defined by its forward and side laser light scatter properties (Fig. 1a) . Using cross-reactive anti-CD3 antibody, the CD3 + lymphocyte population was then identified and selected (Fig. 1b) . This cell population stained negative for IgG and CD11b, specific markers for B cells and myeloid cells, respectively, further supporting that these CD3 + cells are very likely T lymphocytes ( Fig. S1a-c) . Tbet, Eomes and Gata3-specific staining of the CD3 + population indicated a prominent (58%) Tbet + Eomes + double positive population in this particular bat spleen, which may correspond to CD8 + effector T cells (Fig. 1b) . Tbet + Eomes − (that could represent the CD4 + Th1 cell population or early activated CD8 + T cells) and Tbet − Gata3 + population (CD4 + Th2 cells) were also readily detected although the percentages of both cell populations were relatively low compared to the Tbet + Eomes + CD3 + lymphocytes (Fig. 1b) ."
226,2035508,"HCoVs are ubiquitous among humans and are the major cause of respiratory disease, accounting for up to 30% of all common colds. Serologic studies have also suggested that one-half of the infections with coronaviruses are asymptomatic. 84 Two more newly-described coronaviruses, HKU1 and NL63, are also common causes of typically mild, self-limited colds. 85 More severe clinical disease has been described in young children, the elderly and in immunocompromised patients. 86 SARS-CoV emerged in Southern China (Guangdong province) in late 2002; the first victims were those involved in live animal trade and food handlers at restaurants which serve exotic animal meat. 79 Through international air travel, the disease quickly spread to Hong but their efficacies are questionable. 78, 102, 111 Ribavirin, though shown to be active in vitro, did not seem to provide any clinical benefit. An HIV protease-inhibitor (lopinavir-ritonavir) with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV was reported to cause viral load reduction and fewer ARDS and deaths in 41 patients; however, the study was uncontrolled. 112 Another study reported that 19 patients who received 'convalescentplasma' from recovering individuals, which contained neutralizing antibodies, had better clinical outcomes (survival 100% vs 66%, discharge rates 78% vs 23%). 113 Subsequent in vitro and animal (ferrets, hamsters, macaques) studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting the S-protein may provide neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV, resulting in viral load reduction and resolution of lung lesions. 114, 115 In vitro and animal (mice, macaques) studies show that type I interferons, if given prophylactically or shortly after exposure, may protect against SARS. 116 In a small clinical study (n=9), interferonalpha given within 5 days was associated with lower rates of intubation (11% vs 23%) and death (0% vs 8%). 117 Against MERS-CoV, available data have shown that type I and type III interferons are active in vitro; a combination of IFN-α 2b and ribavirin given hours after infection appears to reduce lung injury in a macaque model. 118 Clinical data are limited; among the few patients who received such treatment, no consistent result was observed. In one retrospective study, survival was 30% versus 17% at 28 days, but it did not reach statistical significance. 80, 92, 95, 104, [108] [109] [110] 295 Animal models have suggested potential benefits of other antiviral agents or antibody-based therapies, but no clinical data have been published to date. 119, 296, 297 Systemic corticosteroid treatment is highly controversial. While favorable clinical and radiological responses have been reported, controlled data are lacking. 102, 106, 111 In the only randomized, placebocontrolled study performed during the SARS outbreak, early corticosteroid treatment within the first few days delayed viral clearance. 98 A later systematic review has ded that corticosteroid is not associated with definite benefit, but is likely to be harmful (e.g. metabolic side effects, bacterial and fungal superinfections, avascular osteonecrosis, acute psychosis). 111 Currently, corticosteroid therapy is not recommended in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and avian influenza infections, perhaps except in cases with refractory septic shock and adrenal insufficiency, and should only be given at a low dose (e.g. hydrocortisone 50 mg Q8H). 78, 91 Respiratory Syncytial Virus"

Another research direction is to utilize public accessible data to help the estimation of infection cases or forecast the COVID-19 outbreak [14, 17, 18, 22, 25, 27, 46] . However, most of these existing works mainly focus on Wuhan China; the studies of using computational models to combat COVID-19 in the U.S. are scarce and there has no work on community-level risk assessment to assist with community mitigation by far. To meet this urgent need and to bridge the research gap, in this work, by advancing capabilities of AI and leveraging the large-scale and real-time data generated from heterogeneous sources, we propose and develop an AI-driven system, named α-Satellite, to provide hierarchical community-level risk assessment at the first attempt to help combat the deadly and fast evolving COVID-19 pandemic."
235,2034968,"The final size of an outbreak is greatly affected by transmission events early during the outbreak process. Outbreaks can be curtailed when public health interventions are rapid and efficient. But the severity of an outbreak is often unclear during these initial stages of transmission when intervention can be most effective [11, 27] . Further, there are limits to how quickly diagnostic information about an emerging infection can be obtained and disseminated to health care providers. This is not the first model to consider the effect of changes in the removal rate (e.g., [14, 15] ). However, in contrast to earlier studies, we first explicitly considered societal learning parametrically in a theoretical model. Our model also more realistically represents the ramping up of intervention in contrast to models that simply have ''before control'' and ''after control'' regimes (e.g., [13] ). We showed that the final outbreak size decreases rapidly with a modest investment in learning. We also found strong evidence of learning in data from the 2003 outbreak of SARS in Singapore. Public health interventions for SARS include encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantine, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts [25, 30] . We believe these interventions were highly effective at reducing the final size of the SARS outbreak."

Our case definitions were: fever 38ЊC or higher at presentation or in the previous 2 days, with or without chills or rigor; influenza-like symptoms; new radiological infiltrates compatible with pneumonia; and contact history. Exclusions were preexisting infective lung disorders, aspiration, or hospitalacquired bacterial pneumonia. All cases fulfilled the WHO criteria for probable SARS cases current at that time. 3 Laboratory investigations included haematological (complete blood counts with differentials and clotting profile), biochemical (electrolytes, liver and renal function, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase), and microbiological tests to exclude other causative pathogens (bacterial cultures of blood, sputum, and urine, serologies by microagglutination for mycoplasma and legionella, serologies by direct immunofluorescence for chlamydia, influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial and adenoviruses, nasopharyngeal aspirates for viral cell cultures, and direct sputum smear for Pneumocystis carinii by silver stain).

237,2020842,"The Parvoviridae family consists of non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with single-stranded DNA genomes of 4 to 6 Kb [7, 8] . Eight ICTV-approved genera are currently included in the Parvoviridae family [9] . A recent reorganization of the Parvoviridae has proposed the creation of a third subfamily named Hamaparvovirinae that includes both invertebrate and vertebrate viruses as well as endogenized genomes in the germ lines of fish and invertebrates, suggesting an ancient origin [10, 11] . Vertebrate infecting members of this subfamily are classified within the Chaphamaparvovirus genus (previously labeled as unclassified or chapparvoviruses) and have been identified in rats and mice [12, 13] , bats [14, 15] , rhesus macaques [16] , cynomologus macaques [17] , dogs [18] , pigs [19] , Tasmanian devils [20] , birds (red-crowned crane [21] , chicken [22] , and turkey [23] ) and fish (Tilapia [24] ).

238,1312477,"Among the six inflammatory models, MLR was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with imaging progression on chest CT scans, and correlated with imaging aggravation. Previous evidence demonstrated that monocytes/macrophages were susceptible to human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E infection, but strongly restricted OC43 replication [23] . Differs from HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV poorly infects human purified monocytes/macrophages, and production of interferonalpha by these cells further limits the infection [24] . Following infection of monocytes/macrophages by HCoV-OC43, viability remained high over 6 days and no apoptosis was observed [25] . These clues suggested that monocytes might be stable in function and quantity levels during HCoV infection like SARS and 2019-CoV. Conversely, SARS-CoV frequently targets for cytotoxic T lymphocytes [26, 27] . Lymphopenia is one of hematological abnormalities during SARS-CoV infection, and lymphocyte counts could predict the severity and clinical outcomes [28] . Previous study showed that lymphocytes and its subsets significantly decreased in SARS patients, while those with severe clinical illness or those who died had more remarkable CD4+ and CD8+ lymphopenia [28] . Also, MERS-CoV could efficiently infected T lymphocytes from the peripheral blood and from human lymphoid organs and induced apoptosis in T lymphocytes [29] . Similar with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 2019-nCoV infection also related with loss of lymphocytes, which was supported by Chinese guidelines [30, 31] .

CK/CH/LHLJ/04V is a nephropathogenic strain; however, it lost kidney tropism after 70 serial passages in embryonated eggs. Using a reverse genetics system, the S glycoproteins for a group 2 coronavirus (MHV), a group 1 coronavirus (TGEV) and a group 3 coronavirus (IBV) were demonstrated to be involved in the tropism of these coronaviruses [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] 68, 70] . For the TGEV, several amino acid changes at the Nterminus of the S protein resulted in the loss of enteric tropism [29, 30] . In this study, an amino acid substitution was found at residue 581 (Leu → Phe) between P70 and P110; however, loss of kidney tropism of CK/CH/LHLJ/04V occurred between P40 and P70. The only amino acid difference between P40 and P70 was at residue 58; however, this residue is not likely to be a determinant of tissue tropism of CK/CH/LHLJ/04V, because some viral subpopulations in P70 and P110 showed this change. Several other substitutions were found in S and other proteins in this study. Further investigation by reverse genetics and animal studies is needed to verify the exact function of substitutions."

However, other studies in Australia [11] and Taiwan [12] failed to reveal gender differences in the practice of using face mask. These findings should be interpreted carefully. Differences in findings amongst studies may be due to the change of attitudes over time and cultural differences amongst countries. Moreover, differences in research methodologies may have contributed to the outcome. One study used a relatively small sample size (n = 352) [12] , thereby reducing the representativeness of its sample. Three studies used telephone survey to collect data [9] [10] [11] . Compared with face-to-face interview, a telephone survey is believed to impose extra difficulty for researchers to validate the findings from participants [13] . Thus, studies using other data collection methods, such as face-to-face interview, can provide more valid findings to complement existing findings."

It is well accepted that ARDS and pneumonia in deadly cases are due to severe inflammatory responses to the immune system, this so-called a cytokine storm [23] . On the other hand, severe multi-organ destruction is due to the cytokine storm rather than a direct damaging effect of the virus itself [24] . It is noteworthy when COVID-19 pathogen reached to the alveoli in elderly and weak adults, pro-inflammatory immune responses become vigorous and un-controllable active. Furthermore, impaired anti-inflammatory responses in elderly adults may correlate to increased activity of pro-inflammatory responses [25] . Hence, some elderly adults with severe COVID-19 infection cannot shut down their pro-inflammatory immune response. Several studies reported most patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit markedly increased serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including; IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IL-18, IL-33, TNF-α, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IP10, C-reactive protein (CRP), MCP1, and MIP1α [26] [27] [28] . It is necessary to mention that cytokines storm directly may lead to immune cell death, tissue damage, and respiratory shut down [25] . For example, the autopsy findings of aged subjects revealed spleen atrophy and necrosis, lymph node necrosis, hemorrhage in the kidney, hepatomegaly, and degeneration of the neurons in the central nervous system in COVID-19 patients. The number of immune cells also changed in COVID-19 infection [29, 30] . Indeed, in patients with severe COVID-19 infection, but not in patients with a mild infection, lymphopenia is a common feature, with significantly reduced numbers of CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, B cells and NK cells. Furthermore, exhaustion markers, such as NKG2A receptors on NK cells and CD8 + T cells, are up-regulated in patients with COVID-19 [28, 31] . Histochemical staining showed that CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells were decreased in spleen and lymph nodes. In addition, in the lung with characteristic diffused alveolar damage, the major infiltrated cells were monocytes and macrophages, but very few lymphocytes [32] . Tian and colleagues in 2020 using postmortem biopsies identified alveolar damage, fibrosis of the heart and myocardial hypertrophy, and also lobular infiltration of the liver by small lymphocytes in four died cases of COVID-19 [33] ."
246,2034598,"By the beginning of COVID-19 crisis in China in late 2019, and its spread throughout the world in early 2020, countries around the world experienced numerous problems (1) .The outbreak of the new Coronavirus started in Wuhan, and this third epidemic of Coronaviruses expanded to the middle east promptly. . Therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) expressed its concerns about the Coronavirus crisis (2) . This crisis caused production and publication of large amounts of valid and invalid information, eventually leading to information obesity phenomenon. Information obesity can have many negative consequences on the general population, causing major problems for governments, especially if the amount of invalid information is too large. It is worth to mention that however almost impossible, controlling and monitoring media is a massive challenge for different governments. Hence, individuals should protect themselves against unreliable information, and pursue an authentic ""information diet"". In the present study, authors have explained and interpreted the concept of the information diet, proposed by Johnson, based on scientific evidence, observation of media news and the social media environment, to help maintain the use of valid information in facing the new Coronavirus crisis."
247,508400,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes lethal diarrhea in piglets, resulting in great economic losses all over the world, and is a member of Coronaviridae, causing severe entero-pathogenic diarrhea especially in piglets. PEDV belongs to group I coronavirus which consists of PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Vijgen et al. 2004) , feline coronavirus (FeCoV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and human coronavirus NL63 (NL or New Haven) (BaoXian et al. 2009; van der Hoek et al. 2004) . PEDV and TGEV caused the diseases characterized by rather similar clinical symptoms which make it rather difficult to draw a clear dividing line between them. Both of them replicate in the differentiated enterocytes of the small intestine and cause severe diarrhea (Sanchez et al. 1992) . Several viral proteins are important for inducing an immune response to PEDV: the spike protein (S, 180-220 kDa), the membrane protein (M, (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) , and the nucleoprotein (N, 55-58 kDa) (Egberink et al. 1988 ). The S glycoprotein of PEDV possessed an immunodominant region S1 (Liyun et al. 2008) and plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection. It mediates binding of the virus to the cell surface and the subsequent fusion between the viral and cell membranes (Yeo et al. 2003; Duarte and Laude 1994) . PEDV N protein forms a helical nucleocapsid with genomic RNA and is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells, thus making it a major viral target. Therefore, N protein as a sensitive diagnostic antigen was used to develop specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Hou et al. 2007a; Rodak et al. 2005) . However, N protein was not able to induce immunoprotection against PEDV infection owing to an envelope surrounding the virion shielding (Ge et al. 2009; Hou et al. 2007b) ."
248,111269,"It was of interest to determine whether nsP13 might traverse from the 5 0 -ssDNA tail to the internal gap and facilitate unwinding of the incoming duplex DNA, like a train on a railroad track pushing another train in the lead. To this end, we prepared DNA substrates with a longer trailing duplex (30 bp) and 10-nt gap (substrates in Figure 5B ). As stated earlier, the 10-nt gap was not sufficient for nsP13 to completely unwind the 30-bp DNA duplex on the 3 0 -side, which was unwound when the gapped DNA substrate without the 5 0 -ssDNA overhang was used (0T20bp10G30bp in Figure 5B ). Note that a blunt-ended DNA substrate (the lead 20-bp duplex of 0T20bp10G30bp) slightly unwound under this experimental setup. A portion of the blunt end duplex might have a 5 0 -ssDNA at the end due to breathing of the DNA duplex, which supports unwinding of the 20-bp DNA duplex. However, this effect was not sufficient for the unwinding of the longer 30-bp DNA duplex (square symbols in Figure 5A ). Most importantly, nsP13 was able to completely unwind the 30 bp of the trailing duplex in the 10-nt gapped DNA substrate containing a 5 0 -ssDNA tail (20T20bp10G30bp in Figure 5B ). This result suggests that the translocated nsP13 molecules pile up and facilitate unwinding of the 3 0 -side of the DNA duplex by the helicases that are internally bound at the gap. This may be the reason why the 30-bp DNA duplex containing the 10-nt gap and 5 0 -overhang (20T20bp10G30bp) unwound more efficiently than the gapped DNA substrate containing the longer lead DNA duplex (30 bp) with a blunt end ('10 Gap' shown in Figure 4) . A portion of the nsP13 helicases may stack up after the 5 0 -side of the DNA duplex is unwound and may then unwind the 3 0 -side of the DNA duplex. Therefore, the nsP13 helicase can track through the loading strand and facilitate unwinding of the DNA duplex as long as the translocated helicases stay on the track."
249,1468660,"Worldwide consortiums such as the USAID PREDICT programme as well as many independent academic laboratories around the world have used a combination of consensus PCR screening and deep sequencing to characterize thousands of novel viral sequences in samples taken from healthy bats 135 . Many of these novel viruses, or viral fragments, are phylogenetically related to pathogens of interest to public health; however, the capacity for these novel viruses to cause future outbreaks typically remains unresolved. With viruses isolated or sequenced directly from bat samples and molecular approaches, including viral pseudotype studies and reverse genetics, researchers have been able to demonstrate the potential of novel viruses to replicate in human cells or use human receptors for entry -the first step to incorporate virus discovery into a more comprehensive risk-reduction framework 14, 63, 136 (Fig. 3) . Characterizing the breadth of naturally occurring bat-borne viruses, including close relatives to human viruses, is critical and leads to important insights. For example, the discovery and subsequent investigations of a novel non-pathogenic henipavirus 137 , Cedar virus, related to Nipah virus and Hendra virus, have proved invaluable in revealing the genetic determinants of pathogenicity in henipaviruses. Unlike Nipah virus, Cedar virus does not produce V or W proteins, which are responsible for antagonizing the host interferon pathway, and it also relies on different host cell receptors 138 . The identification of viruses related to Ebola virus in various bat species, including the novel Bombali virus, has provided additional support for bats as reservoirs for Ebola viruses and, even though there are no reports of filovirus haemorrhagic fever in China, filoviruses have also been identified in Rousettus spp. bats in China 139 . Thus, further research is needed to confirm host species range and the potential for human infection 25 . Ancestral variants of zoonotic coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been identified from bats, with some viruses related to SARS-CoV even being capable of using the human receptor ACE2 (reFs 14, 63, 72, 114, 140 ). Although both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have also been isolated from intermediate hosts (palm civets 141 and camels 142 , respectively), it is possible that these two viruses can be directly transmitted to humans from bats."
250,161447,"Archived sera obtained from 94 subjects belonging to at-risk groups working in a wild life market in Guangzhou, 28 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS by RT-PCR, and 152 healthy blood donors in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Southern China were retrieved from À70 C refrigerator. The at-risk groups consisted of game food animal market retailers, animal slaughterers and animal transporting personnel. All subjects were aged 18 years or above. The 94 animal handlers had a mean age of 35.4 years (range, 19e76 years), and the male-to-female ratio was 60:34. All of them had exposure to live and/or dead chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, sparrows, seagulls, turtledoves, cranes, foxes, wild boars, sika deers, rabbits, and/or cats.

251,313775,"The most consistent and important factor influencing household transmission was whether or not the index case was a healthcare worker (adjusted hazard ratio 0.157; 95% CI 0.042 to 0.588). This was independent of length of exposure or demographics. The reason for this finding was not evident from the data available. A difference in social behavior between healthcare worker and nonhealthcare worker is a possible explanation for this disparity in risks of household transmission. For example, healthcare work- ers may be more acutely aware of the risk of acquiring and transmitting SARS and may alter hygiene practices at home. In addition, better health and disease prevention knowledge may influence the efficacy of such practices. Qualitative differences in social behavior between healthcare worker and nonhealthcare worker should be investigated, as this knowledge may be useful in containing future SARS outbreaks."
252,1281964,"We used the search for the identity of the SARS-virus to emphasise the tentativeness of scientific knowledge. All nine scientists considered revision, modification and refutation of existing scientific knowledge to be commonplace in their work. Indeed, their everyday task is not to maintain or safeguard current scientific knowledge but to move science forward by introducing new data and ideas, and providing new frameworks to interpret existing data from different perspectives. The scientists in our study all recognised the theory-laden nature of observation and noted that there can be different interpretations of the same set of data because scientists utilise their favoured theories. Disagreements and arguments among scientists are common and an inevitable stage in the journey towards more established and well-accepted scientific knowledge. The initial acceptance of the paramyxovirus as the causative agent of SARS, and its rapid replacement by the coronavirus as a consequence of new evidence and subsequent empirical tests based on the Koch's postulation, was used to illustrate the tentativeness of science. We also linked tentativeness to some essential characteristics of good scientists-skepticism and openmindedness."
253,1629914,"Notably, while olfactory symptoms were mostly self-limiting, gustatory dysfunction persisted after the resolution of the respiratory symptoms in more than 70% of the patients [2] . Despite not being a constellation of symptoms exclusive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, hypogeusia and hyposmia are recurrent features of COVID-19 even in retrospective studies, where these symptoms were incidentally rather than systematically documented [3] . These very studies support the concept of indolent SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism as part of COVID-19's natural history, with a nevertheless persistent and significant impairment to neuronal function."
254,921258,"From October 2013 to September 2015, over 1000 outbreaks of PED have occurred in Japan spanning almost all prefectures, as reported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (http://www.maff. go.jp). In contrast, we found that diarrhoeic faecal samples from several swine farms have often been negative for PED virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), other enteric viruses (rotaviruses and enteroviruses) since 2014. Some previous studies have reported that PEDV and PDCoV could be simultaneously and frequently detected in faecal samples from pigs with diarrhoea in the regions of the U.S. in which PEDV was epidemic (Marthaler et al., 2014a (Marthaler et al., , 2014b Li et al., 2014) . In addition, three research groups demonstrated that PDCoV is enteropathogenic in pigs in experimental infections Jung et al., 2015 Jung et al., , 2016 Ma et al., 2015) . Therefore, these findings suggest the possibility that PDCoV is one of the major pathogens, in addition to PEDV, causing outbreaks of diarrhoea in multiple swine farms in Japan."

Anaesthesia was induced and maintained with halothane (Fluothane, Ayerst Laboratories, Montreal) using a Bain circuit. Midline laparotomies were performed and up to 14 five cm long segments of the midjejunum were isolated by ligation, with 2-3 cm intervening segments. The 5 cm segments were injected intralumenally with a total 1 ml volume of virus (one injection) and in some experiments IFN (a second injection), both diluted in PBS containing 500 Kallikrein units of aprotinin (Sigma Chemical), a protease inhibitor and penicillin (400 units/ml), streptomycin (0.4 mg/ ml) and gentamicin (0.05 mg/ml). Control inoculations consisted of this PBS diluent except in the experiment involving natural Po IFN-ot, in which case a mock-induced leucocyte supernatant was used as a control inoculum. The incision was then closed in 2 layers and the animal allowed to recover from anaesthesia. Flunixin meglumine ( 1 mg/kg, Banamine, Schefing-Plough) was administered to maintain analgesia post-operatively and water was provided.

259,454543,"Traditional infection-control and public health strategies rely heavily on early detection of disease to contain spread. When Covid-19 burst onto the global scene, public health officials initially deployed interventions that were used to control severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, including symptom-based case detection and subsequent testing to guide isolation and quarantine. This initial approach was justified by the many similarities between SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, including high genetic relatedness, transmission primarily through respiratory droplets, and the frequency of lower respiratory symptoms (fever, cough, and shortness of breath) with both infections developing a median of 5 days after exposure. However, despite the deployment of similar control interventions, the trajectories of the two epidemics have veered in dramatically different directions. Within 8 months, SARS was controlled after SARS-CoV-1 had infected approximately 8100 persons in limited geographic areas. Within 5 months, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 2.6 million people and continues to spread rapidly around the world. What explains these differences in transmission and spread? A key factor in the transmissibility of Covid-19 is the high level of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in the upper respiratory tract, 1 even among presymptomatic patients, which distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, where replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract. 2 Viral loads with SARS-CoV-1, which are associated with symptom onset, peak a median of 5 days later than viral loads with SARS-CoV-2, which makes symptom-based detection of infection more effective in the case of SARS CoV-1. 3 With influ-enza, persons with asymptomatic disease generally have lower quantitative viral loads in secretions from the upper respiratory tract than from the lower respiratory tract and a shorter duration of viral shedding than persons with symptoms, 4 which decreases the risk of transmission from paucisymptomatic persons (i.e., those with few symptoms)."

264,1055451,"The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for respiratory viruses are more sensitive [Johnston et al., 1993; Blomqvist et al., 1999] and may detect viruses at a higher frequency than the traditional virus detection methods. Theoretically, it is possible that a positive PCR ®nding might also sometimes represent subclinical infection or, since RT-PCR assays detect viral RNA, remnants of past infection rather than an active current infection. However, the advantage of RT-PCR techniques for certain important respiratory viruses, namely human rhino-, entero-, and coronaviruses, cannot be questioned since for these viruses no other available practical and rapid techniques exist [Ieven and Goossens, 1997] . While nasopharyngeal colonization in healthy children with respiratory bacterial pathogens is shown by several studies [Faden et al., 1997; Faden, 1998; Bernstein, 1999] , less is known of respiratory viruses in this context. Johnston et al. [1993] have shown that respiratory picornaviruses can be found in 1.4% of healthy children by virus isolation and in 12% by PCR method. There are only a few other studies reported where the presence of respiratory viruses has been demonstrated in healthy children [Horn et al., 1979; Jennings et al., 1987] and in most of the previous studies of respiratory pathogens a control population of normal children was not included."

266,146724,"We report the selection of human mAbs specific to the MERS-CoV S2 subunit (MERS-S2P) using a human synthetic Fab phage display library. Phage display is a powerful tool that has been used for both the discovery of, and therapeutic applications against, infectious diseases [14, 18, 39, 40] . In particular, phage display has been demonstrated to be highly effective for the selection of human antibodies against MERS-CoV, mostly in naïve human antibody phage display formats generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [18] . Although, in general, human mAbs targeting the RBD of the S1 subunit have higher neutralizing potencies than those targeting other regions of the S protein, such as HR1 on the S2 subunit, it is still necessary to combine human mAbs that recognize different neutralizing epitopes due to the emergence of viruses carrying RBD mutations [19, 20] . Mouse G4 mAb is the only mAb demonstrated to bind MERS-S2P with an affinity of 8.9 nM and to neutralize infection of pseudo-MERS-CoV bearing S protein [21] . Recently, it was revealed that the G4 mAb recognizes the connector domain present between the HR1 and HR2 domains of the S2 subunit. This region is variable in sequence and length among betacoronaviruses [13] . Although the two anti-MERS-S2P mAbs (S2A3 and S2D5) selected from our phage display library failed to neutralize infection by MERS-CoV (data not shown), these represent the first human "
267,398029,"The anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties of CQ and HCQ have been catalogued in several studies performed in vitro. [21] [22] [23] The mechanism of action by which CQ and HCQ exhibit antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 has not be fully elucidated but presumed to be due to the alkaline nature of the drug, which causes an increase in pH within endosomes in cells, leading to the prevention of viral entry and transport. In addition, CQ has previously shown an ability to block glycosylation of cell surface receptors, disabling the ability of SARS-CoV-1 to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptors, which exist in abundance in human heart, lung, kidney, and intestines. 24 Since SARS-CoV-2 is thought to utilize the same mechanism for cell attachment and entry, CQ and HCQ exhibit significant promise in blocking initial viral infection in vitro. Given these promising in vitro results and the overwhelming demands of finding an effective treatment in the face of a rapidly evolving global health emergency, multiple in vivo clinical trials were set in motion from December 2019 to April 2020 to evaluate the efficacy of HCQ and CQ as therapeutic agents in COVID-19. Our search showed that there are at present seven such clinical trials with published or prepublished results. However, due to poor study design and haphazardly chosen outcomes, the results of these in vivo studies are less convincing than those in vitro."

269,18104,"Human cytomegalovirus. HCMV is a member of the herpes family. Like other members of this family, HCMV can establish lifelong latent infection in its host, with occasional reactivation. 43 Infection is in general asymptomatic, but can cause serious disease in people whose immune systems are compromised, such as transplant recipients and AIDS patients with HIV infection. Furthermore, children infected with HCMV in utero are at risk for serious birth defects. They may even experience delayed hearing loss and deafness despite being asymptomatic at birth. 43 After several decades of effort, an effective vaccine against HCMV infection remains elusive. 44 Typical adult therapy for HCMV infection is with antivirals such as ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. 45 For children who are suspected to have been infected in utero, treatment with Ganciclovir may prevent developmental problems and loss of hearing. 46 Women with primary infection during pregnancy, a risk factor for congenital HCMV infection and disease (cHCMV), may be treated with HCMV immunoglobulin as a way to reduce the cHCMV risk. 47 Polyclonal preparations of antibodies (IVIGs) are an alternative for antiviral medications that have serious limitations. For example, IVIGs are difficult to standardize and less effective. In contrast, mAbs specifically targeting key epitopes should provide an advantage in efficacy. Multiple HCMV targeting mAbs being developed are in various stages of preclinical and clinical trials. 48, 49 HCMV is a complex virus with multiple antigens, including glycoprotein B (gB) and the gHp entameric complex. 43, 50 The vast majority of antibodies generated against HCMV target its gB antigen. The gB targeting antibodies alone may not have strong neutralizing ability to control HCMV infection and reactivation. 51 Recent studies have demonstrated that the pentameric gH complex is the primary target for neutralizing antiviral antibodies, 50 and as result most recently developed mAbs target the virus' pentameric complex. 51 The use of a combination of mAbs has several advantages, including enhanced efficacy and decreased development of viral resistance. At least two of the HCMV targeting antibodies in clinical trials are combinations of two mAbs. 48, 49 CSJ148: CSJ148 is a combination of two anti-HCMV human mAbs -LJP538, which binds to the viral gB protein and LJP539, which binds to the viral gH pentameric complex. 48 LJP538, also known as 7H3, and LJP539, as 4I22, were isolated from EBV immortalized B cells from HCMV-immune human donors as described. 52, 53 Results from clinical trials show CSJ148 and its component mAbs were safe and well tolerated, with pharmacokinetics as expected for human immunoglobulin. 48 Phase 2 clinical trials of CSJ148 in stem cell transplant patients are ongoing. 54 RG7667: RG7667 is a combination of two mAbs, MCMV5322A and MCMV3068A. 49 MCMV5322A is an affinity-matured version of MSL-109 that binds a neutralizing epitope on HCMVgH/gL. 55 MSL-109 is a human mAb isolated from spleen cells of a HCMV seropositive individual. In the late 1990s, MSL-109, known by several other names including Protovir, SDZ 89-109, SDZ MSL-109, and Sevirumab, was developed by Sandoz in several clinical trials as a therapy for HCMV infection. 56 Development was discontinued after MSL-109 failed to demonstrate improved outcomes in the treatment of HCMV retinitis in AIDS patients and prevention of HCMV infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 56 In addition to the activities in developing MSL-109 as a therapy, the antibody was a subject for a series of mechanistic studies, Fig. 4 Representation of the combination of proteomics and high-throughput sequencing approaches to isolation of relevant mAbs from human donors. Analysis of nucleic acids from B cells combined with proteomic analysis of antibodies in serum provides a deeper understanding of the humoral response to viral infection and vaccinations.

The other component of RG7667, MCMV3068A, binds the pentameric gH complex. MCMV3068A was isolated from a mouse hybridoma and subsequently humanized. 49 RG7667 is developed by Genentech as a treatment to prevent HCMV infection in utero and in solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Phase 1 studies of RG7667 showed to be safe and well-tolerated and had a favorable pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity profile. The study supports further development of RG7667 as a therapy for the prevention and treatment of HCMV infection in susceptible populations. 49 In a Phase 2 trial in high-risk kidney transplant recipients, RG7667 was well tolerated, numerically reduced the incidence of HCMV infection within 12 and 24 weeks post-transplantation; it was statistically significant for delaying time to HCMV viremia, and was associated with few cases of HCMV disease compared to placebo. 58 Influenza. Influenza virus infections are common and usually cause only mild illness. Typical therapy involves respiratory precautions and medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), that inhibit the influenza protein neuraminidase involved in release of virus particles. However, development of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors is a problem. 59 Influenza viruses have a unique flexibility which tolerates small errors, resulting in a change of viral structure known as ""antigenic drift"" that allows escape of the immune response. 60 The seasonal flu vaccine protects against the influenza viruses that are predicted to be most common during the upcoming season. However, the vaccine is not always effective, due to mismatch of the predicted strains with the actual circulating flu strains. A universal flu vaccine with long-term effectiveness remains elusive. 61 Occasionally influenza virus makes a major change that preserves its virulence, as in the case of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. 34 The large antigenic drift renders the seasonal flu vaccine of little efficacy. As a result of the rapid development of antibody isolation and engineering technologies, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies is becoming an increasingly viable approach to address the immediate health threat of an influenza pandemic while vaccines are being developed. MHAA4549A: MAb MHAA4549A, also known as 39.29, was cloned from a single-human plasmablast cell isolated from an influenza vaccinated donor. MHAA4549A binds a highly conserved epitope on the stalk of influenza A HA and blocks the HAmediated membrane fusion in the endosome, and is capable of neutralizing all known human influenza A strains. 62 In two Phase 1 clinical trials, MHAA4549A was safe and well tolerated up to a single intravenous dose of 10,800 mg. The mAb demonstrates linear serum pharmacokinetics consistent with those of a human IgG1 antibody lacking known endogenous targets in humans. 63 MHAA4549A is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials for the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe influenza A infection. 64, 65 VIS410: VIS410 is an engineered human IgG1mAb, which targets the stem (or stalk) region of influenza A HA and has demonstrated binding to both group 1 and group 2 HAs of influenza A viruses. 66 Prophylactic administration of VIS410 resulted in the complete protection of mice from developing acute respiratory distress syndrome against lethal influenza A (H7N9) virus challenge. 67 In a Phase 1 clinical trial, VIS410 was safe and well tolerated and had good relative exposure in both serum and upper respiratory tract. These results support its use as either a single-dose therapeutic or prophylactic for influenza A. 68 VIS410 is currently in a Phase 2a study designed to assess the safety and tolerability of the antibody in subjects with uncomplicated influenza. 69 CR6261: Isolated from combinatorial display libraries that were constructed from human IgM( + ) memory B cells of seasonal influenza vaccinees, antibody CR6261 neutralizes the virus by blocking conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. The antibody is protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge. 5 CR6261 recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the membraneproximal stem of HA1 and HA2. The antibody neutralizes the virus by blocking conformational rearrangements associated with membrane fusion. 70 CR6261 is currently in Phase 2 clinical testing. 71 CR8020: The human mAb CR8020 has broad neutralizing activity against most group 2 viruses, including H3N2 and H7N7, which cause severe human infection. CR8020 was isolated from a B cell of a donor vaccinated against influenza. 72 The crystal structure of Fab CR8020 with the 1968 pandemic H3 HA reveals a highly conserved epitope in the HA stalk distinct from the epitope recognized by the V(H)1-69 group 1 antibodies. 72 CR8020 has been tested in Phase 1/2trials. 73 Structural and computational analyses indicate that CR8020 targets HA residues that are prone to antigenic drift and host selection pressure. Critically, CR8020 escape mutation was seen in certain H7N9 viruses from recent outbreaks. 74 TCN-032: Antibody TCN-032 was isolated from ab IgG( + ) memory B cell of a healthy human subject. The antibody recognizes a previously unknown conformational epitope within the ectodomain of the influenza matrix 2 protein, M2e. 75 This antibody-binding region is highly conserved in influenza A viruses. The region is present in nearly all strains detected to date, including highly pathogenic viruses that infect primarily birds and swine and the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 pandemic strain (S-OIV). In addition, TCN-032 protected mice from lethal challenges with either H5N1 or H1N1 influenza viruses. 75 A Phase 1 clinical study showed that TCN-032 was safe, with no evidence of immune exacerbation based on serum cytokine expression. The trial also showed that the antibody may provide immediate immunity and therapeutic benefit in influenza A infection, with no apparent emergence of resistant virus. 76 Human immunodeficiency virus. Despite decades of intensive effort, an effective HIV vaccine remains a challenge. With recent advances in the identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies from single memory B cells of infected individuals, anti-HIV antibodies are becoming a viable approach for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. 77 A number of broadly HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies are currently in clinical development to assess their therapeutic benefit in passive immunization. Most of the HIV mAbs in clinical testing, for instance VRC01, 3BNC117, 10-1074, and 4E10, are broadly neutralizing on the basis of targeting conserved viral epitopes. 78 PRO 140 is an antibody used to treat HIV targeting host CCR5, which often acts with CD4 as a co-receptor for the virus. 79 Many excellent reviews provide more detail on broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. 77, [80] [81] [82] Here we highlight some examples of HIV targeting antibodies in clinical development. VRC01: VRC01 is a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 mAb isolated from the B cells of an HIV-infected patient. 40, 83 It is directed against the HIV-1 CD4-binding site and is capable of potently neutralizing diverse HIV-1 strains. 84 A Phase 1 study showed that the antibody was safe and demonstrated expected half-life and pharmacokinetics for a human IgG. 85 In two open-label trials of the safety, side-effect profile, pharmacokinetic properties, the antiviral activity of VRC01 was tested in persons with HIV infection who were undergoing ART (antiretroviral therapy) interruption. The antibody slightly delayed plasma viral rebound in the trial participants as compared with historical controls, but did not maintain viral suppression through week 8 86 VRC01 is being tested in multiple Phase 2 trials. [87] [88] [89] 3BNC117: Human antibody 3BNC117was isolated from single B cells of a patient with high titers of broadly neutralizing Antibody therapies for viral infections G Salazar et al. antibodies. This antibody binds to an HIV gp120 core glycoprotein stabilized in the CD4-bound conformation and lacking the variable (V) loops 1 to 3. 90 Antibody 3BNC117 blocked infection and suppressed viremia in macaques infected with the R5 tropic simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-AD8, which emulates many of the pathogenic and immunogenic properties of HIV-1 during infections of rhesus macaques. 91 In Phase 1 trial, 3BNC117 is safe and effective in reducing HIV-1 viremia. 92 In a Phase 2a trial, 3BNC117 suppresses viral rebound in humans during treatment interruption. The antibody exerts strong selective pressure on HIV-1 emerging from latent reservoirs during analytical treatment interruption in humans. 93 In addition to suppressing viremia in HIV-1-infected individuals, 3BNC117 can enhance host humoral immunity to HIV-1 94 . Antibody 3BNC117 is also being tested in combination with a functionally similar broadly neutralizing antibody, 10-1074, in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 91, 95, 96 4E10, 2F5, and 2G12: Antibodies that recognize the highly conserved membrane proximal external region in the gp41 ectodomain stem of HIV such as 4E10, 2F5, and 2G12 have been tested in Phase 1/2 trials in well-suppressed HAART-treated individuals treated during acute and early HIV-1 infection. 97 Pro 140, Ibalizumab, and bispecific antibodies: In addition to antibodies directly targeting viral antigens to prevent and treat HIV-1 infection, antibodies targeting host receptors such as CCR5 and CD4 receptor are also being developed for HIV infection. For example, the CCR5 targeting humanized IgG4 mAb Pro 140 has been tested in clinical trials and the antibody exhibited potent, long-lived antiviral activity and was generally well tolerated. 79, 98, 99 Ibalizumab (iMab), a humanized mAb that binds to a conformational epitope on CD4 and blocks entry of HIV-1, is also being tested in clinical trials. 100 In another approach, bispecific Abs that combine the HIV-1 inhibitory activity of ibalizumab with that of anti-gp120 bNAbs were constructed for passive immunization to prevent HIV-1 infection. 101, 102 Respiratory syncytial virus Palivizumab, motavizumab, and motavizumab-YTE: In 1998, the FDA approved palivizumab, which binds to the F glycoprotein of the RSV for prophylaxis in children susceptible to severe disease. 103, 104 Motavizumab is an affinity matured derivative of palivizumab, tenfold more potent than palivizumab in F glycoprotein binding. 103, 105 In Phase 3 clinical trials, motavizumab recipients had a 26% relative reduction in RSV hospitalization compared with palivizumab recipients, and motavizumab was superior to palivizumab for reduction of RSV-specific outpatient lower respiratory tract infections (MALRIs, 50% relative reduction). 106 A half-life extended derivative of the antibody, known as motavizumab-YTE (motavizumab with amino-acid substitutions M252Y/S254T/T256E [YTE]), an Fc-modified anti-RSV mAb was also tested in Phase 1 trials. 107 Clearance of motavizumab-YTE was significantly lower (71 to 86%) and the half-life was two to fourfold longer than that of motavizumab in healthy participants. 107 The sustained serum concentrations of motavizumab-YTE were fully functional, as shown by RSV neutralizing activity that persisted for 240 days with motavizumab-YTE versus 90 days postdose for motavizumab. 107 Despite the improvements of motavizumab and motavizumab-YTE over palivizumab, the clinical benefits were considered incremental and they have not been approved for clinical use. MEDI8897, REGN2222, and ALX-0171: MEDI8897, which is 100fold more potent than palivizumab in vitro, is derived from D25 108 a mAb isolated from a B cell of a human donor targeting the 110 Not an IgG1 antibody, ALX-0171 is a single-domain camelid-derived antibody, or nanobody, targeting the RSV-F protein. Due to small size of the nanobody, ALX-0171 is being tested as a therapeutic by inhalation in Phase 2 in infants (aged 1-24 months) who were hospitalized with an RSV infection. 111 Ebola, Zika, rabies, and HBV. An outbreak of Ebola in West Africa between 2014 and 2015 affected 28,652 people and led to more than 11,325 deaths. 112 The lessons learned from the handling of that high mortality rate epidemic contribute to the call for taking innovative counter measures against emerging infectious diseases, including the use of mAbs. For example, an experimental mAb cocktail ZMapp was given special approval for compassionate use during the fast-moving epidemic. ZMapp is a combination of three mAbs (c13C6, c2G4, c4G7) optimized from two previous antibody cocktails (ZMab and MB-0033). 113 ZMapp showed protective efficacy in a rhesus macaques challenge model. 113 However, a randomized, controlled human trial of ZMapp plus the current standard of care did not meet the statistical threshold set for improved efficacy as compared with the current standard of care alone (NCT02363322) [114] [115] [116] . Efforts to isolate potent neutralizing antibodies against Ebola are ongoing. For example, potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the Ebola virus surface glycoprotein (EBOV GP) were isolated through sequential immunization of rhesus macaques and antigenspecific single B-cell sorting. 117 Similarly, potent neutralizing antibodies targeting the Ebola EBOV GP were isolated from the peripheral B cells of a convalescent donor who survived the 2014 EBOV Zaire outbreak. 118 These highly potent neutralizing mAbs could serve as promising candidates for prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against Ebola. The outbreak of Zika in 2015-2016 and its association with congenital abnormalities also increased awareness of the urgent need to take measures against emerging infectious diseases. 119 Similar to combating Ebola and other viral infections, development of vaccines is the top priority to protect the population from Zika infection. 120 Antibody-based therapeutics are also proposed as an option for the treatment of Zika infection. 23 For example, two antibodies with potent ZIKV-specific neutralization, isolated from a single patient, provided postexposure protection to mice in vivo. 23 Structural studies revealed that Z23 and Z3L1 bound to tertiary epitopes in envelope protein domain I, II, or III, indicating potential targets for ZIKV-specific therapy. 23 Rabies occurs worldwide and it is almost invariably fatal once clinical symptoms develop. 121, 122 Rabies is mostly preventable if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is administered before clinical symptoms develop. PEP consists of thorough wound cleansing followed by immediate administration of rabies immune globulin (RIG), together with a full course of rabies vaccination. 123 However, due to the lack of education and availability of RIGs and vaccines, it was estimated that global canine rabies causes about 59,000 deaths mostly in Asia and Africa. 121 As the supply of human RIG (HRIG) and equine RIG (ERIG) is often limited, it is desirable to develop potent neutralizing human mAbs to replace RIGs. 123 CL184 is mixture of two human mAbs:CR57 and CR4098. Mab CR57, which binds to an epitope of the rabies glycoprotein, was isolated from a EBV-transformed memory B cell from a human subject vaccinated with inactivated rabies virus. 27, 124, 125 MAbCR4098, which recognizes a non-overlapping epitope of mAbCR57, was isolated from phage-displayed antibody libraries constructed from PBMCs of rabies virus vaccinated human subjects. 126 CL184 has been evaluated in multiple Phase 1/2 clinical studies to be safe and efficacious. 123, [127] [128] [129] HuMab 17C7, also known as RAB1 which was generated from transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin, is another potent rabies virus neutralizing mAb that has been tested in multiple clinical trials in India (CTRI/2009/091/000465 and CTRI/2012/05/002709). 130, 131 There are continuing efforts to identify more potent and broadly neutralizing mAbs against rabies. For example, two antibodies with potency and broad-spectrum reactivity, RVC20 and RVC58, were identified from immortalized B cells of vaccinated donors. 132 RVC20 and RVC58 were able to neutralize all 35 strains of rabies virus in vitro. Furthermore, they showed higher potency and breadth compared to antibodies under clinical development, including CR57, CR4098, and RAB1. 132 Hepatitis B can establish both acute and chronic infections that lead to serious liver disease. Maternal to fetal transmission is one important route keeping prevalence high in regions where the hepatitis B is endemic. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin antibody preparations are one form of countermeasure under investigation. 133 mAbs are also under development to supplement the suite of tools available to control the spread of HBV and associated disease. 134, 135 Dengue. Dengue is the world's most prevalent mosquito-borne disease, with an estimated 390 million people each year becoming infected. 136 Severe dengue, associated with infection with different strains of the virus, is characterized by vascular permeability, bleeding from mucosa and intestinal tract, dengue shock syndrome, and acute renal failure. 137 In contrast with HCMV where severe symptoms are accompanied by a detectable active phase, 138 dengue symptoms often appear after the peak of viremia; 139 therefore, an antibody applied for passive immunotherapy would have to be used before the onset of symptoms to be early enough to avoid viremia. Another difference between HCMV and dengue is that for HCMV, developing fetuses or infants and people with compromised immune systems are clearly at risk for the development of severe disease. 43 In contrast, there are no clear prognostic indicators for susceptibility to severe dengue virus disease. Such prognostic indicators are necessary due to practical limitations on the number of people who can receive passive immunotherapy. Further, dengue antibodies at subneutralizing concentrations may enhance uptake of dengue virus in a way that dramatically aggravates symptoms (antibodydependent enhancement, ADE). 136 Therefore, the development of vaccines has been the focus for dengue control. So far one vaccine has been approved, but the vaccine (CYD-TDV, Dengvaxia, Sanofi Pasteur) is less than ideal and better dengue vaccines are urgently needed. 140 mAbs against dengue have been generated so their interaction with dengue could be analyzed to identify the virus' best target epitopes, a key first step in vaccine design. A summary of these epitopes and their associated antibodies is presented in several excellent reviews. 136, 141 The epitopes targeted by antibodies most effective at neutralizing dengue virus were grouped into broad classifications based on whether these epitopes were present in a single virion (epitopes on a monomer) or were composed of features on more than one virion (quaternary epitopes). Epitopes on a monomer were further grouped according by region of the dengue virion bound: prM protein, FLE (amino acids [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] , BC loop E protein domain II (amino acids 73,78, and 79), or EDIII. Quaternary epitopes were also sub-divided into EDE epitopes (EDI, EDII, and EDIII); E protein epitopes (monomer EDI, EDI-EDII hinge, and EDIII; intact virion only); and E protein herring-bone epitope (EDI, EDI-EDII hinge, and EDIII). Although no dengue antibody therapeutics have reached the stage of clinical trials, some of Antibody therapies for viral infections G Salazar et al."
270,1984286,"In the case of Adv, our results indicate that the age group (≥2, <5) seem to be at the highest risk of getting infected. Until now, Adv has been considered as 1 of the 5 most frequent respiratory Figure 3 . Negative samples were mostly encountered to older ages, with a peak incidence in the age group (≥45, <65). Table 2 The age-related frequency of each respiratory combination pattern. pathogens among children, [16] [17] [18] with infants being the population of the highest risk. In our study, Adv is referred for the first time as the most frequent responsible pathogen in the age group (≥2, <5) and second in priority among all the identified pathogens. These results may reflect a trend of increasing total incidence and higher-age peak incidence for Adv positive cases. RSV is a regular winter visitor that is highly contagious among persons of all ages. [19] Although long recognized as the major viral pathogen of the lower respiratory tract of infants, it has also been implicated in severe lung disease in adults, especially the elderly. [20, 21] This was not confirmed in our study, where most RSV positive samples were noticed in ages under 5 years old. However, it should be noticed that 4 out of the 5 positive cases which occurred in the ages ≥18 (data not shown), belonged to the age group (≥65), highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages. [22] As for samples positive for Influenza (A or B), we should underline the total prevalence of influenza A H1-2009, the high incidence of influenza A H1-2009 in ages under 10 years old and the preference of influenza B incidence in the middle ages. Influenza A and B are important causes of respiratory illness in all age groups. [23] Influenza has been referred as the most common etiologic agent (55.7%), especially among adults. [24] This was not true in our case, except for the age group (≥10, <18). However, influenza A has been previously considered as 1 of the 3 most frequent pathogens in the community setting. [16, 18] Our data indicate that this applies totally to ages over 5 years."
271,1240451,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis in Hong Kong from March to June 2003 resulted in extreme stresses and strains on the general running of hospitals. Generally, SARS patients were accommodated in negative pressure isolation rooms on the ward. When these patients required operative procedures, a negative pressure theatre was considered to be more suitable than a positive pressure environment. In principle, a positive pressure operating theatre with adequate air changes could quickly eliminate the virus from the environment, and it has been shown that the risk of cross-contamination from airborne infection is low if staff are adequately protected with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). 1 However, a negative pressure operating theatre offers optimal protection to personnel working in adjacent areas."
272,896703,"The investigational subvirion inactivated monovalent vaccine was manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur from clade 2.1.3 influenza A(H5N1) (A/Indonesia/05/2005) PR8-IBCDC-RG2 virus, and provided in multidose vials containing either 20 µg/mL or 60 µg/mL HA, as determined by single radial immunodiffusion. Sterile phosphate-buffered saline, provided in single-use vials, was used as diluent. AS03 adjuvant, manufactured by GlaxoS-mithKline Biologicals, is a proprietary oil-in-water emulsion containing DL-α-tocopherol, squalene, and Tween 80 in 10dose vials.

273,2037849,"As mentioned, forecasts for Georgia with a 50% reduction in transmission rate suggest in excess of 10,000 fatalities by the end of September 2020 ( Figure 6 , [11] ). Currently, there are no proven therapies for COVID-19 [36] . Social distancing has been the primary public health intervention to reduce spread of COVID-19, enhanced and supported by local and national stay-at-home orders. However, this type of intervention strategy may fail if it is relaxed too soon [12, 37, 38] and is already coming into scrutiny by members of the public given the associated socioeconmic and ancillary health costs. Other interventions such as serological shielding [10] , digital contract tracing [39] and COVID-19 vaccinations [40] hold promise when they can be integrated as part of strategic decision making."
274,2381964,"Rhinoviruses belong to the picornaÕiridae family: small icosahedral viruses with an average diameter of 300 A and a molecular mass of approximately 8.5 = 10 6 Da.

Other French researchers noted that no acute viral infection has been successfully treated with chloroquine in humans in the past (Touret and de Lamballerie, 2020) , and even more severe viral infection was seen in chloroquine-treated animal model for dengue fever (Guastalegname and Vallone, 2020) ."
276,2259671,"Expression of the ACE2 receptor is also found in many extrapulmonary tissues including heart, kidney, endothelium, and intestine [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Importantly, ACE2 is highly expressed on the luminal surface of intestinal epithelial cells, functioning as a co-receptor for nutrient uptake, in particular for amino acid resorption from food [20] . We therefore predict that the intestine might also be a major entry site for SARS-CoV-2 and that the infection might have been initiated by eating food from the Wuhan market, the putative site of the outbreak. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can indeed infect the human gut epithelium has important implications for fecal-oral transmission and containment of viral spread. ACE2 tissue distribution in other organs could explain the multi-organ dysfunction observed in patients [21] [22] [23] . Of note, however, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [24], whether a person can get COVID-19 by touching surfaces or objects that have virus on them and then touching mucus membranes is yet to be confirmed."
277,1619581,"Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome length of approximately 27 kb. The 3' end of the genome encodes four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) as well as several non-structural proteins [1] . The S glycoprotein of IBV forms projections on the surface of the virion. Spike is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 subunit forming the outermost portion and S2 forming a stalk-like structure that is embedded in the viral membrane. The S1 subunit contains hypervariable regions that play a role in attachment to host cell receptors, and it contains conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes [2, 3] . Spike is also involved in membrane fusion and viral entry into the host cell. The E and M proteins are integral membrane proteins involved in assembly of the virus. The N protein is closely associated with the viral genome and plays a role in replication. The 5' two-thirds of the genome, approximately 21 kb, encodes two polyproteins 1a and 1ab. A minus one frame-shift mechanism is used to translate the 1ab polyprotein. The polyproteins are post-translationally cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsp 2-16 (IBV does not have an nsp1) that make up the replication complex. Key nsps encoded, include a papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) within nsp 3, a main protease (Mpro) within nsp 5, and the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) within nsps 11 and 12. Genetic diversity in coronaviruses is due to adaptive evolution driven by high mutation rates and genetic recombination [4] . High mutation rates are attributed to minimal proof reading capabilities associated with the RdRp. Recombination is thought to be due to a unique template switching ""copy-choice"" mechanism during RNA replication [5] . Evidence of recombination among strains of IBV has been observed both experimentally and in the field [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . The emergence of several alpha-and beta-coronaviruses has been attributed to recombination [12, 13] but only recently was recombination shown to be the mechanism behind the emergence of a novel gamma-coronavirus, turkey coronavirus (TCoV) [14] . Although ""hot spots"" of recombination in the genome of IBV have been reported [9, 15] , a thorough study of recombination using multiple different strains across the entire genome has not been conducted."

279,1224437,"The best protection against challenge is achieved by a vaccine containing homologous strains (Gelb et al., 1990) . As previously demonstrated in some reports, cross-protection is poor between different serotypes and genotypes of IBV strains. Consequently, currently available vaccines cannot provide sufficient protection for heterologous challenge Gelb et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) . The S1 gene of IBV has serotype-specific and neutralization-specific epitopes. Serotype evolution and the genetic diversity of IBV are monitored by analysis of the S1 gene. The majority of QX-like IBV isolates present in the field in China had poor similarity in the S1 part of the spike protein with vaccine strains, indicating the antigenic differences and large evolutionary distances between vaccine strains and IBV field strains in China (Liu et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2014) . Despite the widespread use of live attenuated IBV vaccine (mass serotype), such as strains H120, H52, and Ma5, vaccinated chicken flocks usually fail to achieve complete protection against field virulent IBV challenge. The poultry industry has, in recent years, detected an increasing incidence of outbreaks related to QX-like IBV strains of different serotypes in many countries (Abro et al., 2012; Terregino et al., 2008; Valastro et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2007) . Optimal vaccines against circulating IBV strains in China require attenuated vaccines designed from local strains in China. A previous IBV isolate (the YN strain) was passaged 118 times through SPF chicken embryonated eggs. As a result of this process, the virus becomes more adapted to the embryo, reflected by more efficient replication and higher pathogenicity for the embryo (data not shown). This attenuated YN strain was inoculated via the oral or oculonasal route into SPF chickens to compare the tissue tropism and pathogenicity to its parent strain."

In infected Vero E6 cells the protein could be detected also in the cytoplasm ) and protein 3b is likely to be expressed during infection in vivo. In Cos-7 and Vero E6 cells, overexpression of protein 3b caused apoptosis (Yuan et al. 2005b; Khan et al. 2006 ). As seen for protein 3a, transient over-expression of 3b deregulates cell cycle progression of Cos-7, HEK293 and Vero E6 cells and causes growth inhibition and cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Whereas the induction of cell cycle arrest was comparable in all used cell lines, the ability to induce apoptosis was significant in Cos-7 cells, but almost undetectable in HEK293 and Vero E6 cells (Yuan et al. 2005b ). In addition, when Vero E6 cells were transiently transfected with protein 3b, increased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a key marker of cells undergoing necrosis, were released. Therefore, the authors concluded that the accessory protein 3b is able to induce necrosis (Khan et al. 2006 )."
281,2039686,"Many efforts involve the targeting of nonstructural protein, spike protein, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) entry receptor for the anti-COVID-19 drug development (Abdelli et al., 2020; Babadaei et al., 2020; Basit et al., 2020; Elfiky, 2020a Elfiky, , 2020b Hasan et al., 2020; Nejadi Babadaei et al., 2020; Sinha et al., 2020; Wahedi et al., 2020) . Targeting the components responsible for replication of SARS CoV-2 may be also a good strategy to identify effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19. Like SARS and MERS corona viruses, the SARS CoV-2 genome also contains two open reading frames namely ORF1a and ORF1ab (Boopathi et al., 2020) . These two ORFs help in translating two overlapping viral polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab required for viral replication and transcription (Grum-Tokars et al., 2008; Marra et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003) . The functional polypeptides are released from the pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins by proteolytic processing by the papain-like proteinase (PLpro) and the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) (Grum-Tokars et al., 2008; Marra et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003) . PLpro and 3CLpro are responsible for the cleaving of three sites and 11 sites, respectively within the viral genome (Harcourt et al., 2004; Thiel et al., 2003) . As 3CLpro cleaves most of the sites of the polypeptide, it is also known as the main protease or Mpro. Different studies have identified Mpro as a cysteine protease with a Cys-His catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) in the active site of the protease (Blanchard et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020; Osman et al., 2020) . As Mpro plays a vital role in polyprotein processing and virus maturation, it is considered to be an important target for designing antiviral drugs against SARS CoV-2 Yan et al., 2003) . In addition, there is no human homolog of Mpro which makes it an ideal antiviral target (Kim et al., 2016) . Apart from this, the high-resolution crystal structure of Mpro protease along with its inhibitor is recently made available, which has eased the way in designing structure-based Mprospecific inhibitors to combat this viral disease Yang et al., 2003) . Utilizing computational approach, investigators have identified many small molecules including HIV and malaria drugs as SARS CoV-2 protease inhibitor (Adeoye et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020) . Interestingly, many antiviral phytochemicals, bioactive compounds from Moroccan medicinal plants (Crocin, Digitoxigenin and b-Eudesmol) and chemical compounds from Indian spices (Carnosol, Rosmanol and Arjunglucoside-I) are proposed to be effective SARS CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors (Aanouz et al., 2020; Das et al., 2020; Enmozhi et al., 2020; Gyebi et al., 2020; Islam et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020; Umesh et al., 2020) ."

283,1630562,"We report the detection rate of selected viral and bacterial pathogens among children <5 years of age hospitalized with SARI in Niger. We detected respiratory viruses in 78 % of our study sample. The high detection rate of viruses found in our study is consistent with results from similar studies conducted in Burkina Faso (73 %) [23] , Kenya (68 %) [24] and Brazil (85 %) [12] . However, lower rates of viral detection were reported from other studies from countries such as Ghana (26 %) [25] , China (56 %) [26] and Egypt (60 %) [4] . These differences can be attributed to different climatic conditions, enrollment criteria, case definitions and testing platforms."
284,128921,"The derived estimate is key in interpreting the severity of the 2019-nCoV infection. Presently, the case fatality risk among confirmed cases (cCFR) has been estimated to be in the order of 3%-6% [5] . However, the risk of death among all infected individuals is likely much smaller. With our estimate of 10% ascertainment, the actual risk of death is therefore 0.3% to 0.6% among all infected individuals (abbreviated as iCFR or IFR) [6] , which may be comparable to the Asian influenza pandemic of 1957-1958. However, it should be noted that quoted values of IFR may be oversestimated if the ascertainment rate is biased due to difficulties in detection of 2019-nCoV using RT-PCR (e.g., very short detection window of the virus during the course of infection)."
285,1972509,"Despite the large number of assays developed in the aftermath of the outbreak of SARS-and MERS-CoV, serological differentiation of HCoVs remains challenging. Overall, it can be concluded that problems with cross-reactivity are more likely to arise with a more conserved antigen, and will often manifest as false positive results. Whether IF, ELISA or WB assays are the preferred screening tool depends on availability of molecular biological techniques, the exact study design as well as the number of samples. Compared to whole virus antigen, assays using recombinant proteins are in general more reliable and can be more easily standardized. Preferably, a recombinant serological assay should use an antigen which is highly immunogenic and provides epitopes specific for its virus species. In addition it is of importance that the protein is expressed in its natural conformation, i.e., displaying proper folding and glycosylation. As discussed above in case of coronaviruses only the S proteins combines all these features. Regardless of assay or antigen used, we recommend a thorough validation using a defined set of sera reactive with other HCoVs as well as a large number of negative serum samples from patients with other respiratory diseases. In any case, great care should be taken in selecting the most appropriate assay and the limitations of each assay should be considered when interpreting results. In our opinion to ultimately confirm serological results it is indispensable to perform a VNT as it is the most specific assay available."

287,2533681,"A current model of the COVID 19 epidemic 1 appears to have differing degrees of projected total deaths in various areas of the United States despite close timing of social distancing measures. For example, California with a population of approximately 40,000,000, began social distancing measures on March 19, 2020, yet is projected to plateau at 1,616 COVID 19 related deaths by May 15, 2020. New Jersey, by contrast, with a population of approximately 9,000,000, began social distancing measures on March 18, 2020 yet is projected to plateau at 3,915 COVID 19 related deaths by May 1, 2020. Factors other than social distancing may in part explain this discrepancy."
288,1384169,"Over the 2-year period, 1,702 specimens were submitted for respiratory virus investigation to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Of these 1,637(93%) were from children <5 years of age. For the purpose of this study 627 (36.8%) were selected randomly out of every month for real-time PCR screening of which 610 (97.3%) were from children <5 years of age and used in further investigations (Table I) . Within each year, the patients in the selected study group did not differ significantly from the complete patient group with respect to percentage hospitalized patients, age, and sex. The HIV sero-prevalence of the patient group (32%) is comparable to the HIV sero-prevalence in the Gauteng province of South Africa ($29.3% among antenatal clinic attendees by 2008) (www.doh.gov.za/ docs/nasspsf.html, 2009) although 58.5% of patients were of unknown status. The sampled patient group had a higher HIV sero-prevalence (61.45%) but a greater number of patients were of known status due to subsequent blind testing of unknown samples as part of another study for which the data were made available for this study [Kresfelder et al., unpublished data; Venter et al., 2009a] (Table I) ."
289,2808602,"With ease of travel, the world has become increasingly susceptible to outbreaks of new and reemerging infectious diseases that can spread quickly because of ease of transportation and rapid movement of people within regions and continents. The virus has spread beyond mainland China to countries around the globe and two cruise ships are now confirmed to have been affected. WHO has recommended that countries with frequent air travel exchange with Wuhan should take precautionary public health measures and undertake screening and infection control activities. The lock-down of Wuhan City seems to have slowed international spread of COVID-19 but many challenges remain before it can be brought under control [30] ."
290,2889591,"Although our diagnostic panel was incomplete, lacking parechoviruses and parainfl uenza type 4 virus, we detected >1 respiratory viruses in 92% of the children who had a common cold. As expected, rhinovirus was the leading cause of the common cold in these children. The role of picornaviruses was also emphasized by the abundance of enteroviruses. Enterovirus has gained attention mainly in severe infections, e.g., meningoencephalitis, and is rarely included in diagnostics for respiratory infections. However, PCR has shown that enterovirus commonly causes upper and lower respiratory infections that may be complicated by AOM or expiratory wheezing (4, 7) . Thus, enterovirus should be included in the diagnostic panels of respiratory infections. HBoV was the second most prevalent virus in our study population. Since its discovery in 2005, HBoV positivity has been reported in 3%-19% of different study populations (8) . Its pathogenic role has been questioned because most HBoV cases are co-infections with other viruses (8) , and 81% of those testing positive for HBoV in our study had co-infections. However, adenovirus and enterovirus reached similar coinfection frequencies, likely because of prolonged postinfection viral shedding of these agents. HBoV-specifi c immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibody responses were recently reported in children with wheezing, suggesting that HBoV induces a systemic infection and is probably a true causative agent of lower respiratory tract disease (9) . Our study indicates that HBoV may also be a common cause of common cold in young children. However, we found hMPV, coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and infl uenza C virus in 1%-4% of the children, suggesting that these viruses play a minor role in childhood common cold. Our study may underestimate the role of RSV and hMPV because we excluded children with AOM, which is frequently related to these viruses. Multiple viral fi ndings were common in our study, and 3 children had 4 viruses concomitantly, a logical fi nding because young children are constantly exposed to respiratory viruses, especially if they attend day care. A recent follow-up study showed that almost all viral fi ndings were related to symptoms, thus supporting the argument that most, if not all, viruses are causative agents (10) ."
291,2725783,"Wuhan. 2 A later study, which used the data of travelers from Wuhan, estimated the mean incubation period as 6.4 days (95% CI 5.6-7.7), ranging from 2.2 to 11.1 days. 9 Similar studies reported a shorter incubation period (median 4 days) for patients outside Wuhan. 6 Our study suggests that person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 can occur rapidly from infected adolescent and young adults to their family contacts. We recorded six family-clustered events of COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.5 days (95% CI 2.5-17.4), which is shorter than that (7.5 days, 95% CI 5.3-19.0) estimated from early patients in Wuhan. 2 Most importantly, we estimated the median serial interval to be 1.9 days (95% CI 0.4-6.2), which was still lower than that (4.0 days, 95% CI 3.1-4.9) estimated in a recent modeling study. 11 We provided evidence supporting the transmission of COVID-19 from adolescent and young adult asymptomatic patients to their family or close contacts. In this study, of the four out of 46 patients identified as asymptomatic cases, three were identified as the index patients in their families. The two asymptomatic primary cases had neither symptoms nor chest CT findings during the treatment. One asymptomatic primary case suffered from difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness in the 17 days during treatment. Most importantly, all of their family contacts developed symptoms before the admission date of the asymptomatic index patients. Our findings were consistent with the existing evidence. Rothe et al. first reported that an asymptomatic Chinese woman might be the transmission source for her two German business partners. 12 Tong et al. reported a two-family cluster of COVID-19 patients in Zhejiang Province after each family's primary case contacted an asymptomatic case of COVID-19 from Wuhan. 13 Recently, a similar study has identified a 20-year-old "
292,2069674,"As shielding and social distancing of varying degrees was instigated across most European countries, the provision of conventional models of HF service delivery was either suspended, or reconstituted in a virtual format through telephone consultations or the use of telemedicine. [1] [2] [3] Clinical trial evidence confirms that the integration of telehealth bolsters HF practice, 4-6 but today's service providers noted requests for information from many patient-carer dyads on 'keeping well' and 'who to contact' if HF symptoms deteriorated. Services also reported the worrying observation of a reduced number of patients across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease attending hospital Emergency Departments. The effect of this trend may become evident later, in an increase in all-cause mortality as further data emerge. Recent position statements released both nationally and internationally have reiterated the importance of maintaining HF specialist services to facilitate prompt healthcare access for patients at points of crisis, 3, 7, 8 requiring professionals to adopt variants of a previously accepted HF service structure. 9 As the pandemic subsides and HF services are reconfigured, some effective elements of the new virtual care models could be incorporated, avoiding some of the risks inherent in care transitions, and consolidating a more seamless continuum between hospital-based clinics and primary care."
293,2039609,"At the beginning of the simulation, only one node, chosen at random, is infected while all the remaining population is susceptible. Every susceptible node connected to the infected individual becomes exposed with the transmission probability p whereas the infected node might itself recover with probability r . The probability p can be calculated as p = R 0 / (τ symp D ) , where τ symp is the average time duration of symptoms. We assume that the symp-toms last for a time τ distributed according to an exponential distribution F (τ ) = λe −λτ . Once a node is exposed, it stays exposed for an incubation time t i , chosen according to a given distribution [24] . After this period it becomes infected and is able to infect other nodes. It follows that r ≈ λ = 1 /τ symp , for small λ. For P (t i ) we have used a ( α, β) distribution, as in Wu [25] . Fig. 1 illustrates the network of contacts, states of individuals ( S, I, E , or R ) and the infection dynamics. For the simulations, we fixed the number of individuals N = 20 0 0 , the average degree D ≈ 98, mean incubation time 6.5 days with standard deviation 2.6 days ( α = 6 . 25 and β ≈ 0.96), R 0 = 2 . 4 and τ symp = 14 days [26, 28, 27] .

296,438718,"Mouse hepatitis virus type-4 (MHV-4) infection in mice is one of the best examples of virus-in-duced central nervous system (CNS) disease in an animal model (Wege et al., 1982; Kyuwa and Stohlman, 1990) . Intracerebral (i.c.) infection with MHV-4 induces an acute fatal encephalomyelitis in almost all the laboratory strains of naive mice (Stohlman and Frelinger, 1978; Knobler et al., 1981) . Survivors show evidence of chronic demyelination and occasionally suffer severe hind leg paralysis. Various factors including virus strain, route of infection, genetic background and immune status of the host are known to modify the infection. Recently, some reports have focused on immunological therapy of MHV-4 infection in the CNS and demonstrated that in vivo treatment with antiviral monoclonal antibodies protected mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection (Buchmeier et al., 1984; Fleming et al., 1989) . In addition, adoptive transfer of CD4 + helper T cell (Th) clones which induce a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response also protects mice (Stohlman et al., 1986) . However, viral replication in the brains of these mice is scarcely affected by these therapeutic treatments."
297,1565192,"The S2 subunit of the S protein is known to be palmitoylated (Bos et al., 1995; Niemann and Klenk, 1981; Schmidt, 1982; Sturman et al., 1985; van Berlo et al., 1987) , most likely through covalent acylation of one or more cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich region of the CD. Whether acylation is in some way important for S protein assembly is unknown. Theoretical analysis using the hydrophobicity scale (Eisenberg et al., 1982) predicts this domain to form an amphipathic alpha-helix in which the cysteine residues occur clustered on one side of the helix (data not shown). It is conceivable that hydrophobic acyl chains connected to the cysteines promote membrane association of the alpha-helical domain by inserting into the lipid bilayer. It is of note that an amphipathic region also occurs in the carboxy-terminal domain of the M protein (Rottier, 1995b) . This domain has a strong tendency to associate with membranes by itself (Mayer et al., 1988) . Mutation studies have shown that deletions in this domain severely affect interaction of M with the S protein (de Haan et al., 1999) . It is thus feasible that incorporation of the S protein into the coronaviral envelope is mediated by interactions between the amphipathic domains of the two proteins."

The specimens included throat swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, sputum and aspirated sputum, together with blood samples, on the day of hospitalization. All the blood samples tested negative for antibodies directed against influenza virus A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus and adenovirus by commercially available ELISA kits. All these clinical samples were taken after informed consent was obtained from parents or other legal guardians, DNA extraction from clinical specimens was performed as follows. Throat swab and nasopharyngeal aspirates were diluted in 2 ml of PBS, and were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 200 µl PBS. The sputum and aspirated sputum specimens were digested with 3 volumes of 4% NaOH, and were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm at 4°C for 5 min. Pellets were further washed with PBS and resuspended in a final volume of 200 µl PBS. All these resuspended pellets were extracted DNA using QIAamp blood mini kit (QIAGEN). A plasmid (pskHBoV) containing the HBoV sequence (nts 1-5299) was synthesized by extension of PCR fragments with primers designed based on the ST2 sequence of HBoV [Genbank: DQ000496], and this was subsequently inserted into pBluescript vector (Stratagene). This plasmid was used as a control (1 genomic copy = 5 × 10 -12 µg) to establish the standard curve for absolute quantification using TaqMan technology with an Applied Biosystems 7500 system (Foster City, Calif.) as a quantitative PCR method [15, 16] . The amplicon and the TaqMan probe for this HBoV specific quantitative PCR were designed by Primer Express 2.0.0 software(Applied Biosystems) in the conserved regions of the NS coding region among HBoV genome sequences deposited in GenBank. Their sequences are as follows: forward primer, 5' AGC TTT TGT TGA TTC AAG GCT ATA ATC (HBoV nts 1417 to 1444); reverse primer, 5' TGT TTC CCG AAT TGT TTG TTC A'3 (HBoV nts 1500 to 1480); and the probe, 5'FAM-TCT AGC CGT TGG TCA CGC CCT GTG-TAMRA3' (HBoV nts 1446 to 1469). TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) was used for amplification with the standard protocol. 5 µl of extracted DNA was used in a reaction volume of 25 µl."
299,2194162,"The discovery of viral pathogens has been intensified in the last decades by improved molecular methods (SISPA [1] , random priming based assays [2] , universal primers [3] and representational difference analysis [4] ). With the introduction of high throughput sequencing, the chance and possibilities of identifying a new virus increased even more. The costs per nucleotide sequenced reduced dramatically, whereas the amount of data retrieved from a single experiment increased massively. Consequently, retrieving thousands of sequence reads from a single sample allows, in theory, identification of a virus even with moderate or low viral loads. The unbiased virus discovery amplification method used at our institute is VIDISCA, a restriction enzyme recognition based amplification technique that allows amplification of RNA or DNA sequences regardless of the genome composition [5] . The PCR products of VIDISCA can easily be sequenced via next generation sequencing techniques when adaptors carrying the Roche-454 necessary tail (A and B tails) are ligated during VIDISCA. The VIDISCA-454 assay allows virus amplification in respiratory clinical samples without the necessity to culture [6, 7] . No more than +/− 5,000 reads from a respiratory sample are needed to have a satisfactory assay sensitivity of VIDISCA-454 [6] . However, the question is if the method is sensitive enough for other clinical materials. A virus hunt to identify novel viruses involved in various diseases, for example undiagnosed diarrhea or Kawasaki disease, will have to be performed in materials other than respiratory samples. Most likely, these clinical materials have different sample specific background, e.g., feces will contain a lot of bacteria that might lead to a reduced amplification of viral sequences. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether viral fragments can be detected in non-respiratory clinical samples. In this study we focused on the performance of VIDISCA-454 in fecal material and serum samples."

302,1463867,"The severe pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 is caused by a 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) which was first detected and characterized in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 [1, 2] . Later, the name of this virus was suggested as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [3] . SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen and showing high infectiousness, fast spread, partial asymptomatic infection, and other new features [4, 5] . At present, the virus has been detected in the most countries and regions around the world, threatening public health, normal social life, and economy. SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions of people with more than 250,000 deaths worldwide as of May 8th, the viral envelope, N protein plays an important role in virus replication and pathogenesis [19, 20] . Based on seven conserved replicase domains in pp1ab (polyprotein-1ab) for the classification of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of the genus Betacoronavirus in the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae together with human SARS-CoV and bat various SARSr-CoVs (SARS-related CoVs), and SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to bat coronavirus Bat-CoV-RaTG13 genetically [1, 21, 22] . Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) as receptor, besides, the serine protease TMPRSS2 plays an important role in activating spike (S) protein [23] . Some novel features of SARS-CoV-2 has been revealed, like a furin protease cleavage site in the Spike which may be related to viral transmissibility [24] . Recently, a novel bat-derived coronavirus RmYN02 with the similar furin insertion in the S was found which emphasized the bat origin of the virus [25] ."
303,881452,"Although MERS-CoV has been reported to undergo some genotypic changes since it emerged in the human population [12, [126] [127] [128] [129] , this has not resulted in distinct phenotypic changes so far [63, 126] . Therefore, host factors remain the most significant determinant in explaining inter-and intraspecies variations observed in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. DPP4 and MERS-CoV-recognized α2,3-sialic acids might partially explain these variations, since their localization has been demonstrated to be variable between MERS-CoV-susceptible species [69, 71, 84, 100] . DPP4 expression in human lungs has also been shown to vary due to certain comorbidities [70, 96, 104] . Nevertheless, it is undoubtable that the inter-and intraspecies variation in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission is a complex phenomenon influenced by more than one host factor. Current data suggest proteases and interferons as other critical host factors, but how they instigate inter-and intraspecies variations, as well as their role in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission, still remain to be further elucidated. Characterization of the host determinants of MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission could potentially offer insight into this virus epidemiology and guide novel therapeutic development. It may also help to identify the most vulnerable individuals to protect against MERS-CoV infection-for example, by using vaccination."
304,1981227,"VLPs are produced in several systems, including bacteria, mammalian cells, yeast, plants, and insect cells. Insect system is a promising system for high yield and rapid production of VLPs (Vicente et al., 2011) . Moreover, insect systems can induce post-translational modifications similar to mammalian cells, facilitating the assembly of VLPs (Fang et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2013) . VLP-based vaccines, including hepatitis C virus (HCV), papillomavirus, enterovirus type 71 A (EV71), influenza virus A, and SARS-coronavirus (CoV), have been developed in insect systems (Baumert et al., 1998; Acosta-Rivero et al., 2004; Lechmann et al., 2001; Senger et al., 2009; Lopez-Macias et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2004) results in a high yield of HIV-1 VLPs and proper cleavage of envelope precursor protein (Yang et al., 2012) . In a previous study, VP2/6 double-layered rotavirus-like particles containing Wa capsid protein were produced in S2 cells transformed with a bicistronic expression system consisting of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)-derived internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element (Lee et al., 2011) . Glycoprotein (GP), nucleoprotein (NP), minor matrix protein (VP) 24, and VP40 originating from EBOV Makona was artificially synthesized. The amplified inserts were cloned into the BglII and XbaI sites of the plasmid pMT/V5/His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and were confirmed by sequencing. NP, GP, and VP24 of Ebola virus have been shown to facilitate assembly and release of VP40 eVLPs (Kallstrom et al., 2005) . Therefore, to assess EBOV protein expression, Drosophila S2 cells were transfected with EBOV plasmids using transfection reagent (TranIt-2020; Mirus, USA); at 24 h before harvesting, cells were treated with 250 μM CuSO 4 to induce protein expression. The cells and culture supernatants were harvested, and EBOV protein expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Invitrogen) for 15 min on ice, and lysates were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The culture supernatants were collected and concentrated using a 30 kDa Centrifugal Filter with Ultracel-30 membrane (Millipore, Germany). To visualize the released particles, the concentrated supernatants were centrifugated through 25% sucrose and then negatively stained. The cell lysates and concentrated supernatants were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after heating at 70°C for 10 min, and the proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in TBS/Tween solution containing 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with primary anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-NP (Alpha Diagnostics, USA), anti-VP40 (Cosmo Genetech, South Korea), and anti-GP antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TBS/Tween solution, and incubated with secondary anti-mouse-AP, anti-rabbit-AP, or anti-human-AP antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, membranes were washed three times, and proteins were detected using a BCIP/NBT substrate kit (Invitrogen). As shown in Fig. 1A , we confirmed that Ebola viral proteins were efficiently expressed in EBOV Makona-transfected S2 cells. The formation of VLPs similar to Ebola virus particles was visualized in both EBOV Makonatransfected S2 cells and culture supernatant by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 1B ). As negative control for VLPs formation, we used cells which were transfected with GP, NP, and VP24 without VP40. As shown in Fig.1B , filamentous particles of approximately 50 nm in diameter and 1400 nm in length were observed in culture supernatant of EBOV Makona-transfected S2 cells."

It spread rapidly throughout China, resulting in a nation-wide epidemic; moreover, there were reports of sporadic cases globally. Previously published reports describe the imaging features of patients with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia [2, 3] . These reports have highlighted the clinical importance of chest computed tomography (CT) for the detection and management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, the infection control in the CT suite is also critically important because high rate of presumed hospital-related transmission of COVID-19 (41.3%) was reported [1, 4] . Radiologists should not only be aware of the CT features of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia but they must also be well informed of the infection control protocols to be followed inside the CT suite to prevent the spread of infection. Herein, we present our experience with infection control protocol for COVID-19 inside the CT suite."

We report the first case of meningitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 who was brought in by ambulance due to a convulsion accompanied by unconsciousness. He had never been to any foreign countries. He felt generalized fatigue and fever (day 1). He saw doctors nearby twice (day 2 and 5) and was prescribed Laninamivir and antipyretic agents, His family visited his home and found that he was unconsciousness and lying on the floor in his vomit. He was immediately transported to this hospital by ambulance (day 9). Under emergency transport, he had transient generalized seizures that lasted about a minute. He had obvious neck stiffness. The specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab but was detected in a CSF. Anti-HSV 1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. A brain MRI showed hyperintensity along the wall of right lateral ventricle and hyperintense signal changes in the right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, suggesting the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 meningitis.

311,2034323,"In Coronaviruses, ORF1 is translated to yield the polyprotein that is processed by proteolysis with the production of intermediate and mature nonstructural proteins (nsps). In Figure 2 we highlight the position of the variant sites on the Polyprotein with respect to known domains, as defined by the Conserved Domain Database ). Position 265 corresponds to residue 85 of the non-structural protein 2 (Nsp2) which is characterized by four transmembrane helices (TH) (Angeletti et al. 2020) , whose role is still unknown. More in detail, position 85 lies at the N-terminal, which protrudes from the external face of the membrane. Interaction analysis of the corresponding protein from SARS virus shows that Nsp2 can form dimeric or multimeric complexes that can also involve additional viral proteins (Nsp3, Nsp4, Nsp6, Nsp8, Nsp11, Nsp16, ORF3a) (von Brunn et al. 2007) suggesting that Nsp2 might be involved in the viral life cycle. SARS Nsp2 also interact with host proteins, such as prohibitin 1 and 2 (Cornillez-Ty et al. 2009 ), that are involved in cell cycle progression, migration, differentiation, apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis (Fusaro et al. 2003; Merkwirth and Langer 2009; Rajalingam et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2004) suggesting it might be important to manipulate prominent host functions. Murine Hepatitis Virus and SARS-CoV strains deleted in this portion of the polyprotein (Graham et al. 2005 ) have a strongly reduced viral growth and RNA synthesis, but are not affected at the level of protein processing. Ectopic expression of the nucleotide sequence coding for Nsp2 in murine cells infected by strains missing Nsp2, allowed to detect its recruitment in viral complexes. It is therefore possible that Nsp2 is involved in global RNA synthesis, interaction with host proteins and pathogenesis (von Brunn et al. 2007 ). In infected cells, Nsp2 seems to be present in small vesicular foci, but in absence of additional viral proteins it localizes in cytoplasmic or nuclear membranes, without a specific target (Prentice et al. 2004; von Brunn et al. 2007 ). Unfortunately, mutagenesis experiments are still not available for SARS-CoV2, and therefore we still do not know whether the variant observed at this site has any effect on in vivo virus properties."

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12) is the central component of coronaviral replication/transcription machinery and appears to be a primary target for the antiviral drug, remdesivir. We report the cryo-EM structure of COVID-19 virus fulllength nsp12 in complex with cofactors nsp7 and nsp8 at 2.9-Å resolution. In addition to the conserved architecture of the polymerase core of the viral polymerase family, nsp12 possesses a newly identified βhairpin domain at its N terminus. A comparative analysis model shows how remdesivir binds to this polymerase. The structure provides a basis for the design of new antiviral therapeutics targeting viral RdRp. domain (residues A250-R365) (Fig. 1, A and B ). An additional N-terminal β-hairpin (D29-K50), built with the guidance of an unambiguous cryo-EM map ( fig.

The nsp7-nsp8 pair shows a conserved structure similar to the SARS-CoV nsp7-nsp8 pair (9, 11) . The orientation of the N-terminal helix of the separate nsp8 monomer bound to nsp12 is shifted compared with that in the nsp7-nsp8 pair ( fig. S4A ).

To ensure heterogenicity, participants were selected from various fields of expertise: medical microbiology ( Selected participants furthermore had specific expertise in epidemiology, diagnosis and management of invasive fungal diseases or fungal disease guideline development. The meeting was prepared by PEV, RJMB, JW and FLvdV. Case definitions were developed through a process of informal consensus. Although a systematic literature review was not performed, experts in the field presented overviews regarding epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of IAPA, which were followed by a group discussion process designed to allow members of the group to voice their opinions and contribute equally to the decision-making [12] . The goal of the consensus process was to bring the group to general agreement. Presentations and initial discussions took place on a single day meeting in April 2019 in Amsterdam and were continued through electronic exchange of views until consensus was achieved. The chosen framework included host and risk factors, clinical factors and mycological evidence, similar to the framework in the EORTC/MSGERC definitions and the AspICU algorithm [10, 11] . A medical writer made notes of the meeting, which were used as input to write the manuscript. A first draft manuscript was prepared by PEV, BJAR, RJMB, JW and FLvdV and circulated for comments from all experts. The experts reviewed and commented on the manuscript.

We modelled the period from 1 January 2020 when local authorities closed the wet market implicated as the zoonotic source of human infection (World Health Organization, 2020) up to and including 22nd January 2020. We only considered human-to-human transmission in our model, and made the assumption that following the closure of the market, no further zoonotic infection contributed to the epidemic dynamics.

This is higher than previous study (62.34%) in Changsha that used traditional PCR, 18 and lower than that a study in Lanzhou that used real-time PCR. 6 On the one hand, the high detection rate in our study could be caused by the greater sensitivity of real-time PCR compared with traditional PCR. On the other hand, it is possible that the detection rate differs geographically. RSV was the most frequently virus detected in patients with respiratory infections, followed by PIV3, HBoV, ADV, and HMPV. Our data support previous reports of RSV, PIV3, HBoV, ADV, and HMPV as the major agents associated with LRTIs among children in a hospital setting. 12, [19] [20] [21] [22] The HBoV infection rate (24.1%) in the present study is consistent with earlier reports (1.9%-24.6% 8, 9, 16, [23] [24] [25] [26] , and the incidence of HMPV (18.2%) in patients with respiratory tract infections is similar to that in other regions (1.5%-18% 2, 9, 17, 23, [26] [27] [28] .

In such cases, SeqTrack can use an optional rule to select the 'best' ancestor, and select the closest ancestor according to a given proximity measure. For instance, this approach can be used to select, among all equally parsimonious ancestors, the one being geographically closest. Another possibility would consist in favoring ancestors whose haplotype is most frequent in the sampled isolates. By default, SeqTrack resolves ties in the choice of ancestors by maximizing the likelihood of the genetic differentiation observed between the ancestor and the descendent.

319,1753629,"Coronaviruses comprise a large and diverse family of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. The Coronaviridae exhibit broad host range, infecting many mammalian and avian species and causing upper respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system diseases. In humans and fowl, coronaviruses primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections, while porcine and bovine coronaviruses establish enteric infections that result in severe economic loss. Coronaviruses of laboratory mice are, for historical reasons, designated as mouse hepatitis viruses (MHVs), but among these only a subset are strictly hepatotropic. Enteric strains are commonly found in rodent colonies and neurotropic strains are exploited to study central nervous system infection and demyelinating disease (Perlman et al., 2000) . The extraordinary variations in host range and tissue tropism among coronaviruses are in large part attributable to variations in the spike glycoprotein. The S protein is a large, type I membrane glycoprotein that contains distinct functional domains near the amino (S1) and carboxy (S2) termini. These spikes function to define viral tropism by their receptor specificity and perhaps also by their membrane fusion activity during virus entry into cells. Recently their natural variation has attracted the attention of researchers interested in determinants of viral host range, virus entry, and virus-receptor interactions and their relationship to tropism."
320,667330,"In summary, the performance of the PRV assays yielded better sensitivity compared to culture. Each assay showed differences in sensitivities for individual viruses. While the ResPlex II test offers the broadest range of virus detection, and the MultiCode-PLx the greatest ease of use, the xTAG showed increased sensitivity and had the ability to subtype Influenza A. New generation assays promise enhanced sensitivity, faster turn around time, and additional viral and bacterial targets. 9,31 These multiplex assays should assist in identifying respiratory virus infections, aiding in patient management and investigation of outbreaks."
321,1489157,"Guidance issued by the General Medical Council uses the term 'social media' to encompass blogs and microblogs (such as Twitter), internet forums (such as doctors.net), content communities (such as YouTube), and social networking sites (such as Facebook and LinkedIn) [1] . These have all been employed in attempts to spread information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, official government channels on Twitter and Instagram regularly published the latest government statistics and advice, whilst encouraging the public to follow guidelines. Slogans such as 'Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives' were able to further their reach through social media. The government has also advertised on platforms frequented primarily by teenagers, such as TikTok, enabling information to reach audiences of all ages. This may be more difficult with traditional advertising methods. Hand hygiene is of extreme importance in the prevention of COVID-19 transmission [2] , and YouTube videos were consequently created to demonstrate proper handwashing techniques to the public. YouTube videos were also utilised for the education of health professionals, such as to demonstrate proper donning of personal protective equipment.

323,1862692,"The dissemination of COVID-19 in the systemic circulation or across the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone (Figure 1 ) during an early or later phase of the infection can lead to cerebral involvement as has been reported in the past for SARS-CoV affected patients. 3 The presence of the COVID-19 virus in the general circulation understandably enables it to pass into the cerebral circulation ( Figure 1A−C) where the sluggish movement of the blood within the microcirculation could be one of the factors that may facilitate the interaction of the COVID-19 virus spike protein with ACE2 expressed in the capillary endothelium. Subsequent budding of the viral particles from the capillary endothelium and damage to the endothelial lining can favor viral access to the brain ( Figure  1B) . Once within the milieu of the neuronal tissues, its interaction with ACE2 receptors (Figure 1C , D) expressed in neurons 2 can initiate a cycle of viral budding accompanied by neuronal damage without substantial inflammation as has been seen with cases of SARS-CoV 3 in the past. It is important to mention here that, long before the proposed anticipated neuronal damages occur, the endothelial ruptures in cerebral infections. The movement of the COVID-19 virus to the brain via the cribriform plate close to the olfactory bulb can be an additional pathway that could enable the virus to reach and affect the brain. Additionally, the findings like an altered sense of smell or hyposmia in an uncomplicated early stage COVID-19 patient should be investigated thoroughly for CNS involvement."
324,2468242,"Conventional vaccine preparations against HPAI H5N1 are produced by propagating virus in embryonated chicken eggs or mammalian cells. The vaccine viruses used are either reassortants or low pathogenic wild-type avian viruses.

In addition, these vaccines have several other limitations as reviewed elsewhere [5, 6] . Hence, other vaccine strategies against HPAI H5N1 have been explored including the use of, among others, live attenuated influenza vaccines [7, 8] , live vaccines based on heterologous viral vectors such as pox virus [9] , adenovirus [10] , baculovirus [11] and Newcastle disease virus [12] , and DNA vaccination [13] .

326,2264686,"The pathogenesis of the symptoms produced by rhinovirus infection of the upper respiratory tract is not known. Cytopathologic changes in the nasal mucosa appear to be minimal during rhinovirus colds. Two different studies of biopsy specimens from human volunteers have found no consistent changes of the nasal epithelium in rhinovirus infection [4, 13] . Examination of the cells present in the nasal secretions of infected volunteers revealed that infected ciliated cells are shed from the nasal epithelium during rhinovirus colds [2] ;however,the low number of cells observed is consistent with the absence of findings in the biopsy studies. The absence of histopathologic findings led to the suggestion that the viral infection triggers inflammatory responses that result in the production of symptoms [2, 3] . In 1984, Winther et al. [4] reported that the number of PMNLs in the nasal mucosa was significantly greater in biopsy specimens taken from volunteers during symptomatic upper-respiratory-tract infections than in specimens taken during convalescence or from asymptomatic control subjects. A study in volunteers with experimental rhinovirus colds re- (table 2) . In contrast, medium from HeLa cellsinfected with RSV attracted 9 PMNLs/lO hpf, compared with 7 PMNLs/lO hpf attracted by medium from control tubes.

It remains to be determined whether the chemoattractants produced by infection with these viruses are identical."
327,2448193,"Type I IFN-a and Type III IFN-L induce overlapping proximal signaling events and downstream antiviral responses, despite engaging different heterodimeric receptors (Kotenko et al., 2003; Lazear et al., 2015; review; Zhang and Yoo, 2016; review) . Consistent with this result, all three IFNs (IFN-a, rpIFN-L1, and rpIFN-L3) provoked the expression of the antiviral genes ISG15, OASL, MxA, and IFITM1, 3 in IPEC-J2 cells. However, the magnitude of these antiviral responses triggered by IFN-a and rpIFN-L were dissimilar, as 1000 ng/ml IFN-a stimulation resulted in an approximately 2fold reduced expression of ISG15 and MxA compared with rpIFN-L 1 and rpIFN-L3, but IFN-a more efficiently up-regulated IFITM1 expression than rpIFN-L1 (Fig. 5) . Although the different expression of IFNAR and IFNLR1 in epithelial cells accounts for the variation of the profiles of the induced antiviral genes, distinct signaling events of IFN-a and IFN-L might contribute to the different levels of antiviral genes observed in this study. Recent studies have demonstrated that IFN-L specifically activates JAK2, although both IFN-L and IFN-a/b lead to the activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases JAK1 and TYK2 (Odendall et al., 2014; Odendall and Kagan, 2015; review) . In addition, interestingly, the transcriptional profiles of antiviral genes elicited by rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 are not the same, even though rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 engage the same receptor (Fig. 5) . Further studies are needed to identify the Collectively, we demonstrated that rpIFN-L1 and rpIFN-L3 displayed robust antiviral activity against PEDV infection in both IPEC-J2 and Vero E6 cells. rpIFN-L up-regulated the expression of several antiviral proteins, including OASL, ISG15, MxA, and IFITMs. The transient expression of IFITM1 and 3 inhibited PEDV infection in vitro. Moreover, rpIFN-L1 provided better viral inhibition against PEDV infection of IPEC-J2 cells than porcine IFN-a. Our findings indicate that porcine IFN-L might represent a promising therapeutic agent for PED in the future."

329,2776425,"Altogether, a total of 141 stool samples from children with AGE were assessed for the presence of HBoV. The prevalence of 5.7% for HBoV in this study was comparable to other studies that have investigated HBoV in children with diarrhea worldwide [16] [17] [18] . Several of these studies have indicated that HBoV prevalence in patients with AGE ranges between 0.8% to 42% [16, 17] . The high detection of HBoV in children from the clinics (outpatient) in the current study suggested that HBoV could be associated with mild to moderate diarrheal cases and asymptomatic cases [19] . Results from this study further suggest that HBoV could be seen as an emerging viral pathogen in the rural communities of South Africa. Although HBoV is considered a potential cause of diarrhea, available evidence supporting the causative role of the virus in acute gastroenteritis is inconclusive [20] . The presence of HBoV in asymptomatic individuals raises questions regarding the role of the virus in gastrointestinal infections as a pathogen or just as a bystander [20] . This is due to limited available studies investigating the pathogenesis of HBoV due to the lack of cell culture systems or animal models [12, 21, 22] ."

It was not until 1970 (Ward, 1970) that a viral etiology was considered, and then it was not until 1979 that the FIPV was isolated (Black, 1980; Evermann, et al., 1981; McKeirnan, et al., 1981; O'Reilly, et al., 1979) . The exact virus etiology was preceeded by several years of serology studies utilizing heterologous, cross-reacting coronaviruses, such as TGE and CCV. These studies revealed that coronavirus infection was quite common especially in catteries in which the population of seropositive cats approaches 85%. Although FIP was, and still is, considered to be 100% fatal once clinical signs developed, there is a lack of correlation between the incidence of coronavirus seropositive cats and those that succumb to FIP. It was during this same time frame that FECV was reported Pedersen, et al., 1981b) . These observations are consistent with the interpretation that the feline coronaviruses are comprised of divergent strains of virus that are closely related antigenically and genomically, but vary in their pathogenicity for cats (Barlough and Stoddart, 1990; DeGroot et al, 1988; Horzinek et al, 1982; Pedersen et al, 1978) ."
333,3048555,"Method: This is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak. Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. Results: Ninety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%. Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%. Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%. One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders. Conclusion: The outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe. PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders. Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks."
334,3030848,"Introduction Surveillance systems for acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children currently are often limited in terms of the panel of pathogens and the age range investigated or are only syndromic and at times only active in the winter season. Methods Within PID-ARI.net, a research network for ARI in children in Germany, an active, year-round surveillance system was formed in three regions from north to south for population-based analysis. Children from birth to 16 years of age were included and up to 19 noncolonizing airway pathogens were tested for with multiplex RT-PCR. Results In the 10-year period from July 1996 to June 2006, a total of 18,899 samples were tested. The positive rate increased with the size of the test panel to up to 72.9%. Picornaviruses (35-39%), paramyxoviruses (23-28%) and orthomyxoviruses (5.8-12.5%) comprised the highest fraction. Reoviruses and Legionella pneumophila were not found at all and Chlamydia pneumoniae and Bordetella parapertussis only rarely. Respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 were anticyclical in rhythmicity with metapneumovirus and PIV1 and PIV2. The age medians per pathogen depended predominantly upon the attack rate and interepidemic intervals. Conclusion Active surveillance systems for ARI are superior to passive systems. They should be pathogen-specific and comprehensive for viruses and bacteria and age ranges. They should be population-based and multilevel to avoid bias. The impact of atypical bacteria in children was highly overestimated in earlier studies."

336,3106151,"Enveloped viruses have evolved complex glycoprotein machinery that drives the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, permitting entry of the viral genome into the cell. For the paramyxoviruses, the fusion (F) protein catalyses this membrane merger and entry step, and it has been postulated that the F protein undergoes complex refolding during this process. Here we report the crystal structure of the parainfluenza virus 5 F protein in its prefusion conformation, stabilized by the addition of a carboxy-terminal trimerization domain. The structure of the F protein shows that there are profound conformational differences between the pre-and postfusion states, involving transformations in secondary and tertiary structure. The positions and structural transitions of key parts of the fusion machinery, including the hydrophobic fusion peptide and two helical heptad repeat regions, clarify the mechanism of membrane fusion mediated by the F protein."
337,2473464,"The statement ""Someone who needs the device sooner, has the right to use it even if he is less likely to survive than the next patient"" is the sort of reverse statement of disconnecting the device in favor of the patient with a better prognosis. The opinion of majority of citizens' and the HCWs was against this statement, although it still contained less than 50% of the opinions. These findings are close to Biddison et all study which showed that 43.7% of lay people and 59.5% of HCWs are against this criterion although their study was done in a no critical supply shortage time (7) . Based on citizens' concerns about incorrect diagnosis and early or inappropriate disconnection of the ventilator from patients, it seems necessary to take into account 1) criteria for excluding patients who have clearly weak prognosis and are unlikely to respond to ICU care 1 1 based on good level of evidences, 2) reassessment of patient's response to ICU care, and 3) explaining the policy of reassessment of patient for continuation of ventilation to patients and their family on admission (27) ."

340,105,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), was declared a global public health emergency on 30 January 2020. Emerging data suggests that COVID-19 has extrapulmonary manifestations and complications, subsequently leading to multiorgan failure and death. Common cardiovascular and renal complications reported to be associated with COVID-19 include myocardial injury, heart failure, acute kidney injury and electrolyte disturbances. (1, 2) In addition to the observation that older patients, males and those with pre-existing comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease and chronic liver disease are at highest risk for severe illness or death, (3, 4) COVID-19 complications have been shown to correlate with the disease severity or mortality. (5, 6) Emerging data also suggests COVID-19 contributes to adverse hepatic manifestations such as acute hepatic injury. Wang and colleagues in their recent published study to investigate characteristics and prognostic factors in 339 elderly patients with COVID-19, a high proportion of severe and critical cases were observed as well as a high fatality rate. Over hospital stays ranging from 2 to 28 days, the pooled incidence was 69.1% (67.3-70.9) for elevated ALT (2 studies); 34.8% (16.2-56.0) for elevated AST; 11.2% (6.4-17.1) for acute hepatic injury (15 studies) and 7.9% (5.9-10.2) for hypoproteinaemia (n=2 studies) ( Figure 1A) . Subgroup analyses suggested that the incidence of acute hepatic injury was higher in Chinese populations and groups with a higher prevalence of pre-existing chronic liver disease; however, the incidence of acute hepatic injury was similar in older (≥60 years) or younger age (<60 years) groups ( Figure 1B) . Patients with pre-existing liver dysfunction appear to have worse outcomes in COVID-19, (8) which has been attributed to their immunocompromised status. "
341,596004,"Despite overwhelming systemic disease, virus was not detected uniformly throughout lymphoid tissues (Table 2 ). Both central lymphoid tissues (mesenteric lymph node, mediastinal lymph node, spleen and thymus) and peripheral lymphoid tissues (popliteal lymph node, cervical lymph node, and femoral bone marrow) were examined. Virus was found in 75% of central tissues (36 of 48 tissues examined) compared to 27% of peripheral tissues (9 of 33 tissues examined) ( Table 2 ). Shedding of virus in feces was demonstrated in 3 of 12 cats. Histological lesions colocalized with virus. Lymphoid depletion, lymphoid necrosis/ apoptosis, and pyogranulomatous inflammation were more prevalent in central tissues while lymphoid hyperplasia was more likely to occur in peripheral lymphoid tissues (Table 2 ). In all tissue where virus was detected by RT-PCR, lymphoid depletion or necrosis/apoptosis was observed. No lymphoid depletion or necrosis/apoptosis was evident in tissue negative for viral RNA. In these studies, we did not determine whether lymphocyte destruction was due to necrosis versus apoptosis. Both processes have been previously described in FIPV-infected cats (Haagmans et al., 1996) . Recent studies have shown apoptosis is a common feature in the pathogenesis of infection for several Coronaviridae members (An et al., 1999; Belyavsky et al., 1998; Liu et al., 2001; Sirinarumitr et al., 1998) . FIPV, in particular, induces lymphocyte apoptosis predominantly in the CD3+ T-cell population (Haagmans et al., 1996) . Depletion of circulating lymphocytes is also a common feature of FIPV infection and was observed in this study as well (Fig. 1) . However, the lymphopenia was not due to depletion of a specific phenotype as CD4+ Tcells, CD8+ T-cells, and B-lymphocytes were markedly reduced in all cats with clinical disease (data not shown). "
342,345581,"In summary, we show here that the FIV TM cytoplasmic tail is modified by the addition of palmitate to the four highly conserved cysteine residues present in this Env domain. Moreover, our results indicate that the two most membrane-proximal cysteines (residues 804 and 811) are more essential to FIV functions than cysteines 815 and 848, since mutants C804S and C811S are poorly fusogenic and the simultaneous mutation of these residues not only abrogates Env fusion ability but Env incorporation into virions as well."
343,240016,"We illustrated our method with a reconstruction of a plausible scenario for the spatiotemporal spread of the A/H1N1 influenza strain during the early stages of the 2009 influenza pandemic. This data set might not be ideal for showing the full potential of the new methodology, which may be best suited for the reconstruction of transmission trees in more localized settings. Nonetheless, the results suggest that SeqTrack can contribute to a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of emerging pathogens, even at a worldwide scale. The results are largely in line with the general epidemiological understanding of the spatiotemporal spread of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. We also recover individual Reconstructing disease outbreaks T Jombart et al ancestries that seem sensible and correlate with human flight data. It is not entirely straightforward to compare our reconstruction with previous phylogenetic work based on sequence data from the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic (Fraser et al., 2009; Parks et al., 2009; Rambaut and Holmes 2009; Smith et al., 2009; Lemey et al., 2009b) . These authors used a smaller set of isolates and did not specifically aim to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics with the exception of Lemey et al (2009b) , who analyzed 242 isolates sequenced for the HA and NA genes. They also recovered a strong connection between Mexico and Texas and multiple instances of transmissions from the United States and Canada to outside the Americas. In contrast to their results, we infer a larger proportion of direct transmissions from North America to other continents. For instance, although we infer several direct transmissions from North America to China, their reconstruction points to China being only indirectly connected to the United States through either Russia, Europe or South America."

346,2524173,"There have been a number of infection outbreaks in Saudi Arabia in recent years, most significantly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) [5] [6] [7] [8] . Most outbreaks have occurred in government hospitals, consistent with the results of our study suggesting greater confidence and preparedness of staff in private hospitals compared to government hospitals. The largest hospital-associated outbreak occurred in a government hospital in Jeddah in 2014, in which illness spread among both hospital patients and HCWs [5, 9, 11, 12] . Other government hospital-based clusters of MERS-CoV cases occurred in Riyadh in 2014 and 2015 [5, 22] . A World Health Organization (WHO) investigation revealed issues such as overcrowding in emergency department waiting rooms, and inconsistent application of basic infection control procedures, such as hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), as factors in MERS-CoV outbreaks in hospitals in Saudi Arabia [11] . In the Jeddah hospital, aggressive improvement in infection control deficiencies resulted in a decline in cases [18] . The MOH introduced new infection prevention and control guidelines for MERS-CoV patients [6, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Many of these guidelines are generally applicable to infection prevention and control for all infectious diseases, with emphasis on standard, contact, droplet and airborne precautions, management of overcrowding, and triaging in the emergency department [6] . The MOH expressed the hope that they would be strictly adhered to by all HCWs and in all healthcare facilities [6] . Despite this, in our study the majority of staff of all professions did not think staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines, or that all staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact. Nurses generally tended to have more confidence and be less uncertain than the other professions on these and other questions. While nurses were more likely to be female than male, gender had no impact on responses to any of the questions asked, thus the variation in nurses' responses did not relate to gender. Physicians were notably more pessimistic than other staff on these points. While staff in private hospitals were more likely to think that staff in their unit were following promptly infection control policies, rules and guidelines, nevertheless positive responses were confined to a minority of staff, and there was no significant difference across institution types on whether staff can differentiate between different isolation protocols such as droplet or contact. Effective staff training on these elements appears to be urgently required."
347,1628809,"Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), following an infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), seem to have an increased risk of thrombotic events (TE), both arterial and venous [1] [2] [3] . Even in the absence of high level of evidence, some centers have consequently modified their pharmacological thromboprophylaxis strategy toward intermediate or full-dose (therapeutic) preemptive anticoagulation (rather than prophylactic dosing) for routine care of COVID-19 patients [2, 4] , exposing them to a higher risk of hemorrhagic events (HE)."
348,1628404,"The spike protein is the coronavirus structural proteins, which plays an important role on pathogenicity in coronaviruses [6, 50] . However, replacing the S gene of Beaudette strain by the virulent strains does not make it virulent [51, 52] . The S protein can be cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits at the S1/S2 cleavage site [53] , the S1 subunit is responsible for receptor binding to the host cells [54] . Whether the S1 gene has an effect on the virulence of the virus is unknown. In this study, the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, expressed the S1 gene of the QX-like strain, which retains the S1/S2 cleavage site of H120, maintained the ability to replicate and exhibited pathogenicity in embryos. However, providing IBYZ S1 sequences to H120 did not increase its virulence to that of rIBYZ. IBVs replicate in many epithelial cells, including respiratory tissues, the alimentary canal, kidney, gonads, and bursa [2, 6] . The QX-like rIBYZ strain is capable of considerable growth in the trachea, lung, and kidney, which leads to severe tissue damage. In addition, this strain caused cilia necrosis and loss, lung congestion and hemorrhage, nephritis, as well as inflammatory cell infiltration in these tissues in infected chickens at different time points postinfection. The ability of IBV to replicate within many respiratory, enteric, and other epithelial surfaces may be partially related to the fact that the attachment of IBV to host cells is dependent on sialic acid on the cell surface being recognized by the S1 subunit [6, 54, 55] . However, the binding of virus to the host cell is the first step in determining tropism and S2 is responsible for membrane fusion [56] . Thus, to further explore the different tissue tropism between rH120-S1/YZ and rIBYZ, we examined the viral loads and histopathology in the tissues of the rH120-S1/YZ-infected group. It was found that rH120-S1/YZ remains moderately pathogenic in the trachea (e.g., some cilia necrosis and loss and decreased secretory cells) but no lesions were observed in the lungs and kidneys of infected chickens, in contrast to chickens infected with the rIBYZ strain. This finding suggests that both the S2 and S1 genes might play an important role in viral tissue tropism as also suggested by others [57] . Another possibility is that the lack of viral replication and damage in kidney following rH120-S1/ YZ is due to lower replication ability of backbone except S2 gene from its parental rH120 strain. The viral load of the respiratorytype strain, rH120 in the different tissues indicated that the viral levels in the trachea, early following infection were significantly higher than those of rIBYZ, which indicates that the ability of the virus to attached to trachea epithelial cells of the rH120 strain was stronger than that of the rIBYZ strain. However, during the later time points post-infection, the level of the rH120 strain was significantly lower than rIBYZ, which suggests that the virulence of IBV depends both on tissue invasion and viral replication ability, as well as other functions mediated by other viral proteins (e.g., non-structural, structural, and accessory proteins) [6, 29, [58] [59] [60] ."
349,3094448,"Recent years have seen progress in the development of statistically rigorous frameworks to infer outbreak transmission trees (''who infected whom'') from epidemiological and genetic data. Making use of pathogen genome sequences in such analyses remains a challenge, however, with a variety of heuristic approaches having been explored to date. We introduce a statistical method exploiting both pathogen sequences and collection dates to unravel the dynamics of densely sampled outbreaks. Our approach identifies likely transmission events and infers dates of infections, unobserved cases and separate introductions of the disease. It also proves useful for inferring numbers of secondary infections and identifying heterogeneous infectivity and super-spreaders. After testing our approach using simulations, we illustrate the method with the analysis of the beginning of the 2003 Singaporean outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), providing new insights into the early stage of this epidemic. Our approach is the first tool for disease outbreak reconstruction from genetic data widely available as free software, the R package outbreaker. It is applicable to various densely sampled epidemics, and improves previous approaches by detecting unobserved and imported cases, as well as allowing multiple introductions of the pathogen. Because of its generality, we believe this method will become a tool of choice for the analysis of densely sampled disease outbreaks, and will form a rigorous framework for subsequent methodological developments."
350,1362892,"Several researchers have studied the 1918 pandemic and estimated some of these key epidemiological parameters. Estimates have ranged from 2-3 for the basic reproductive number, R 0 , when using an SEIR model with a mean latent period of 1.9 days and infectious period of 4.1 days [13, 14] . Using an exponential model and assuming the serial interval to be four days (somewhat based on the assumptions of [13] ), [15] estimated R 0 to be 2.6-10.6 for confined settings (such as prison and ships) and 2.4-4.3 for community settings. The estimates for the mean latent and infectious periods come from [16] and were used again by [17] and [18] . It appears that the original estimates were derived from epidemic data, although their source is not well documented."
351,1463868,"As a member of RNA virus, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) encoded by coronavirus lacks the proofreading capability, which leading to high mis-incorporation rate during replication even with the help of exoribonuclease like ExoN [26] . Together with the genome recombination events, it could cause viral diversity and promote the transmission and disease of coronavirus [27] . At the same time, in order to better adapt to the host, the virus usually mutates continuously under the selection pressure of the host. In particular, some non-synonymous substitution sites with high frequency are often experience strong positive selection [28] . Considering the continuous increase of infected people and the high variability of the virus, it is important to pay attention to the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2. Recently, 7 substitution hotspots in SARS-CoV-2, ORF1ab-G10818T (ORF1ab-L3606F), ORF1ab-C8517T, ORF3a-G752T (ORF3a-G251V) S-A1841G (D614G), G171T (Q57H), ORF8-T251C (ORF8-L84S) and N-GGG608_609_610AAC (N-RG203_204KR) have been reported [29] [30] [31] [32] .

356,1983409,"The second stem and loop like structure [(b)-(c), Fig.  31 resembles the RNA pseudoknot required for efficient ribosomal frameshifting in coronaviruses (Brierly et a/., 1989) . The sequences downstream of the gag-pal junction are relatively conserved in feline leukemia virus, Baboon endogenous virus and murine leukemia virus. Furthermore, computer-aided analysis has predicted a similar secondary structure in this region (Ten Dam et al., 1990) . Moreover, free energy calculations predicted that the pseudoknot structure is more stable than the first stem and loop structure (a)-(b). Mutations of this structure in M-MuLV RNA which destabilized the stem structure, reduced suppression efficiency (pSPgpB, lane 2, and pSPgpC, lane 4) however, restoration of the stem with a different sequence (pSPgpBC, complementary mutations, lane 3) did not restore the suppression. This would suggest either that the primary sequence is of major importance or that the complementary mutations did not restore the proper mRNA folding to enable high level of suppression. However, since all of the mutations introduced downstream of the UAG codon reduced readthrough efficiency we favor the first possibility. Analysis of genetic signals in- volved in translational frameshift between the gag and pal of HIV (Wilson et a/., 1988) did not reveal a requirement for an RNA secondary structure in the readthrough event. On the other hand, the consensus sequences required for Gag-Pol frameshift in Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) include a stem and loop structure downstream to the termination codons (Jacks et al., 1988a) . It seems that the involvement of a secondary structure in translation readthrough by frameshift or by suppression is not a general requirement but rather specific for some viruses (Ten Dam et al., 1990) . The finding that suppression of gag translation termination codon occurs in vitro and in vivo in various cell lines, supports the notion that a cellular glutamine tRNA is responsible for the readthrough of the nonsense codon UAG (Kuchino et a/., 1987; Feng et a/., 1989b; Panganiban, 1988) . Replacement of the UAG gag termination codon by UAA or UGA triplets did not affect suppression, suggesting that the UAG termination codon is not a part of the readthrough signal (Feng et a/., 1989a; Jones et al., 1989) . Thus, our study indicates that the main determinant which facilitates pal synthesis during M-MuLV replication, appears to be the cis RNA sequences downstream of the gag termination codon. This unique genetic system mediates the controlled expression of two genes from one mRNA molecule."

358,343657,"Infection with the DA isolate of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV, a picornavirus) produces an excellent model of delayed onset of chronic demyelination that appears to be an immunopathologic consequence of acute infection or complications of persistent infection (Theiler 1937; Lipton 1975; Lipton and dal Canto 1979; . Although TMEV is an enteric pathogen of mice, certain neurotropic strains when injected i.c. present a un;que biphasic disease (Lipton 1975 ). The first phase, acute infection (2-3 weeks), is characterized by destruction of infected ventral horn neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) gray matter. This phase depends upon dose and strain of virus and thus is not always clinically apparent in all infected mice. If present, the paralysis associated with lower motor neuron disease (LMND) usually stabilizes. The second phase consists of chronic inflammatory demyelinating lesions which may persist for months (Lipton 1975) . In this late-onset demyelinating disease that is associated with chronic TMEV infection, the clinical signs observed are a gait abnormality and loss of righting reflex (RR). Signs generally occur 9-12 weeks following infection, However, Lipton and Dal Canto (1976, 1977) have shown that demyelination is present as early as 3 weeks post-infection, even while signs of progressive LMND may be present."
359,238346,"The wild boar and the domestic pig share pathogens (Lipowski, 2003) . When a particular pathogen establishes a long-life cycle among a wild species, it becomes a reservoir. Although a disease can be sometimes controlled and eradicated in livestock despite the presence of a wildlife reservoir (see, for example, Lutz et al., 2003) , the risk of pathogen transmission from the remaining wildlife reservoir inevitably poses a threat to the success of the campaigns."
360,3123061,"An epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) led to the identification of an associated coronavirus, SARS-CoV. This virus evades the host innate immune response in part through the expression of its non-structural protein (nsp) 1, which inhibits both host gene expression and virus-and interferon (IFN)-dependent signaling. Thus, nsp1 is a promising target for drugs, as inhibition of nsp1 would make SARS-CoV more susceptible to the host antiviral defenses. To gain a better understanding of nsp1 mode of action, we generated and analyzed 38 mutants of the SARS-CoV nsp1, targeting 62 solvent exposed residues out of the 180 amino acid protein. From this work, we identified six classes of mutants that abolished, attenuated or increased nsp1 inhibition of host gene expression and/or antiviral signaling. Each class of mutants clustered on SARS-CoV nsp1 surface and suggested nsp1 interacts with distinct host factors to exert its inhibitory activities. Identification of the nsp1 residues critical for its activities and the pathways involved in these activities should help in the design of drugs targeting nsp1. Significantly, several point mutants increased the inhibitory activity of nsp1, suggesting that coronaviruses could evolve a greater ability to evade the host response through mutations of such residues."
361,707346,"Adenoviruses are a recognized cause of acute respiratory infection. They have considerable antigenic diversity, with >54 unique serotypes having been described. 1 The severity of adenovirus-associated respiratory infections varies considerably: Adenovirus has been isolated from asymptomatic individuals 2 or largely associated with mild upper respiratory illness. 3 By contrast, adenovirus has been implicated in outbreaks of severe respiratory disease among military trainees, some with fatal outcomes. 4, 5 The heightened risk of adenovirus infection among military recruits stimulated the initial development, as well as the reintroduction, of an adenovirus vaccine specifically for these populations. Routine use of adenovirus vaccine at military training centers has led to significant declines in overall rates, as well as dramatic shifts in the etiologic burden, of febrile respiratory illness. 6, 7 Large-scale, population-based studies have described the various clinical manifestations of adenovirus infection and serotype-specific differences in severity at the time of clinical presentation. 8, 9 More recent studies of adenovirus-associated respiratory infections have been done; however, these were restricted to hospitalized children. 10 To our knowledge, few published studies of adenovirus-associated respiratory infection have utilized multiplex diagnostic assays, suggesting that while adenovirus may have been associated with illness, the influence of a coinfecting viral pathogen on symptom severity could not be ruled out. Herein we describe the burden and clinical characteristics of adenovirus-associated influenza-like illness among otherwise healthy children and adults at United States military hospitals from 2009 to 2014."

Collateral damages in this context range from patients avoiding contact to medical professionals despite symptoms, delayed or false diagnoses (because of changes in previously standardized processes) to indirect effects causing psychological and physical diseases [4] [5] [6] . The fear of infection but also misinformation can cause worsening of preexisting psychological disorders and potentially life-threatening conditions [7] [8] [9] [10] .

Pyrimidone derivatives are already being used against viral infections (Phucho et al., 2009; Wierenga et al., 1985; Skulnick et al., 1985; Sharma et al., 2014; Seley-Radtke et al., 2018) . The pyrimidone nucleus is a core component of many of the anti-retroviral drugs (Sharma et al., 2014) .

364,1277915,"Many thanks for the comments and suggestions on our recently published review (Wu et al., 2020) . has been widely spread around the world, and more than two million infected patients have been confirmed until April 16, 2020. It is well recognized that the deleterious impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the central nervous system cannot be ignored. In addition to the first case of the brain damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 in Beijing Ditan Hospital (Xiang et al., 2020) , a recent article also reported a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection-related encephalitis (Ye et al., 2020) . These findings are sufficient to support the deleterious effects of SARS-CoV-2 on brain function, but the exact mechanism remains to be determined. Vavougios et al. (2020) proposed that the furin-like cleavage site of coronavirus is an important determinant for its neurotropism. We found that the S-protein cleavage by furin or furin-like proteases plays a key role in the invasion and virulence of SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) . In addition, furin-like proteases also determine the host specificity 3 and tissue tropism of these coronaviruses (Millet and Whittaker, 2015) , which probably allow coronaviruses to infect nervous system through membrane fusion. However, it has not been determined whether the furin-like cleavage site on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a specific role in its invasion of nervous system. Further studies are therefore strongly required."
365,355614,"Literature holds that the only way to prevent an influenza wave is an effective vaccination program and it is important to increase and coordinate preventive activities to slow virus transmission and to provide enough time for the preparation and distribution of the vaccine [3, 4] . Kilbourne stated that ""no amount of hand washing, public education or gauze masks will do the trick and the keystone of influenza prevention is vaccination"" [31] . In the previous studies, there were differences regarding public support to the vaccine of influenza A/ H1N1 [21, 22, 32, 33] . In their study, Van et al found that 60% of university students and staff were willing to be vaccinated in pre-pandemic period [23] . But they also stated in their discussion, when the pandemic vaccine had been available after their study was ended, vaccination rate was 14% between 8-64 yrs according to Australian National Survey [34] . Although it was diffucult to compare because of the difference in timing and cohort of these studies, the percentage of those willing to be vaccinated in our study group was -7.2%-much lower. Although participants attending health related science were significantly more willing to be vaccinated, still when compared to the other studies the percentage was quite low. Similarly, the participants in our study expressed a negative attitude was observed toward influenza A/H1N1 vaccine and it was perceived the least effective prevention measure by the participants. Surprisingly, a higher proportion believed that herbal remedies were effective. The main reasons provided by our participants for not agreeing to take the vaccine were that it was new, that it might not be effective or safe and a perception that it had many side effects. Also, they thought that they had not been given adequate information about A/H1N1 vaccine. In their study, Sypsa et al. observed that the percentage of people that would probably not/definitely not accept the vaccine increased from 47.1% to 63.1% between 35 th to 44 th week and for the majority of the respondents the main reason for refusing vaccination was the belief the vaccine might have not been be safe [32] . Lau et al expressed that acceptibility of the A/H1N1 vaccine was highly sensitive to cost and also stated that people worlwide were curious about its effectiveness and safety and unless scientific evidence was available, the rate of vaccination in the general populations would be low [22] . Cost is not a factor in Turkey since the vaccine is free and its distribution is managed by the MOH. Our participants were young and healthy and their risk perceptions were at the middle level and they believed that if they caught the swine influenza they would experience mild symptoms of the disease. These factors may have affected their attitudes toward the vaccination against H1N1, although it is known that younger populations are much more susceptible than the elderly [31] . But when we examine their reasons not to be vaccinated, it is seen that safety and effectiveness and lack of information are the major concerns consistent with other studies. At the time of the study there was much coverage in the media about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine which may have effected our study population."
366,3039897,"Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential component of porcine circovirus disease (PCVD) as the disease syndrome is referred to in Europe and porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) as it is referred to in North America. Singular PCV2 infection rarely results in clinical disease; however, PCVAD is often accelerated in onset, enhanced in severity and prolonged in duration by concurrent viral or bacterial infections. Due to its effect on the immune system, PCV2 has also been shown to enhance protozoal, metazoal, and fungal infections. Several retrospective or cross-sectional studies have investigated the presence and prevalence of various infectious agents associated with PCVAD under field conditions. Experimental models confirm that PCV2 replication and associated lesions can be enhanced by concurrent infection with other viruses or bacteria. The exact mechanisms by which concurrent pathogens upregulate PCV2 are unknown. Co-infections may promote PCV2 infection by increasing immune host cell replication and accumulation in tissues thereby enhancing targets for PCV2 replication. It has also been proposed that coinfections interfere with PCV2 clearance by alteration of cytokine production and profiles. The outcome of differences in timing of co-infections in PCV2-infected pigs is also likely very important and is an area where more research is needed. Given the current knowledge base, it is important that veterinarians do a thorough diagnostic investigation on herds where PCVAD is a recurrent problem in order to implement the most appropriate and cost effective intervention strategies."
367,1659980,"A recent study showed that ACE2 is highly expressed in the mouth and tongue, facilitating viral entry in the host. In normal human lungs, ACE2 is expressed in lower lungs on type I and II alveolar epithelial cells. After infection, SARS-CoV-2 entry starts with the binding of the spike glycoprotein expressed on the viral envelope to ACE2 on the alveolar surface. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 stimulates the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the whole SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 complex, inducing fusion at the cell membrane. Endosomal cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is facilitated by a low pH and pHdependent endosomal cysteine protease cathepsins [26] . Once inside the cells, SARS-CoV-2 exploits the endogenous transcriptional machinery of alveolar cells to replicate itself and spreads through the entire lung [26] . Given the critical role of endosomal acidic pH for SARS-CoV-2 processing and internalization, it has been suggested that the antimalarial drug chloroquine could exert a potent antiviral effect by virtue of its ability to increase endosomal pH [27] . Inside the cells, chloroquine becomes rapidly protonated and is concentrated in endosomes [27] . The positive charge of the chloroquine increases the organelle's pH with abrogation of virus-endosome fusion, ultimately inhibiting the infection [27] . In addition to chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine has been considered as a possible candidate for short-term treatment trials [27] . Furthermore, also amiodarone has been suggested as a possible inhibitor of SARS coronavirus spreading by its ability to interfere with the endocytic pathway [28] ."
368,3122457,"In the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, two major emergency disease-control measures were cremation of bodies and enforcement of quarantine for asymptomatic individuals suspected of being in contact with a positive case. Enforced by State-related actors, these were promoted as the only method to curtail transmissions as soon as possible. However, as with other harsh measures witnessed by Liberian citizens, in many cases those measures elicited uncontrolled negative reactions within the communities (stigma; fear) that produced, in some cases, the opposite effect of that intended."

371,1590652,"In the United States, the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Department of Health and Human Services, joined by the directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health, recently published a set of key components for a research response to public health emergencies [35] . After listing the research failures during the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009, the authors called for several actions to be taken before the next emergency event. These actions include (1) identifying potential knowledge gaps and research questions; (2) developing and preapproving generic study protocols; (3) obtaining approval for these protocols from institutional review boards; (4) using prefunded research networks and preawarded justin-time research contracts; and (5) developing an on-call ""ready reserve"" of clinicians, scientists, and other experts to undertake this research. The essential elements of ASPR's research response plan as they might apply to influenza pandemic preparedness were outlined in an article published in 2009 [36] . Unfortunately, none of ASPR's proposed actions has been implemented, and no plans have been made to study immunomodulatory agents (D.S. Fedson, unpublished observation)."

373,2035525,"There are currently no antivirals with proven efficacy approved for the treatment of PIV infections. For children with croup, glucocorticoids and nebulized epinephrine have been associated with improved clinical outcomes. 231, 232 When approved antivirals such as ribavirin have been studied, typically in immunocompromised patients, treatment was not associated with reduction in viral shedding or mortality. 175, 202, [216] [217] [218] [219] 223, 227, [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240] One investigational agent, DAS181, which acts by cleaving the sialic acid receptors from the surface of human respiratory epithelial cells, has been shown to improve symptoms, oxygenation, pulmonary function and nasopharyngeal viral loads in treated subjects with PIV infection. [241] [242] [243] [244] Human Metapneumovirus Nature Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a nonsegmented negative-sense RNA virus that is a member of the Pneumovirinae subfamily of the Paramyxoviridae. There are two subgroups each with two clades of hMPV (A1, A2, B1 and B2); although all four subtypes typically co-circulate, each season often has one subtype that predominates. 245, 246 hMPV codes for similar genes to RSV except that the order is slightly different (3'-N-P-M-F-M2-SH-G-L-5') and there are no NS1 or NS2 genes. 247 Epidemiology hMPV results in typically self-limited upper and lower respiratory tract infections in all age groups with a global distribution. 248 Symptomatic disease appears to be more common among young children and the elderly. 249 Risk factors for hospitalization from hMPV infections in children include age <6 months and the presence of three or more children in the home, whereas female gender, prematurity and genotype B infection were risk factors for severe disease. 250 About 4-9% of children require hospitalization for severe respiratory symptoms or pneumonia. 248, 250 hMPV is identified in 8.5% of adults hospitalized with acute cardiorespiratory illness. 251 Risk factors for hospitalization and severe disease in the elderly include a diagnosis of COPD, asthma, cancer or lung transplantation. The average rate of hospitalization for hMPV (9.8 per 10 000 residents) is similar to the rate for influenza (11.8 per 10 000 residents) in adults ≥ 50 years old. 252 Severe, sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia, have infection in immunocompetent individuals. In studies of wheezing children, 64% had serologic evidence of primary infection. Further, several studies that include asymptomatic control patients have documented an association between presence of HBoV and clinical symptoms. Additionally, these studies have documented a positive correlation between high copy numbers of HBoV1 DNA and HBoV1 monoinfection and respiratory symptoms. 275 Although the exact route of transmission of human bocaviruses is unknown, transmission by inhalation or contact with infectious sputum, feces or urine is probable. The mechanism of cell entry and host range are not known. Although most HBoV1 is detected in the upper airway, clinical symptoms and positive BAL specimens suggest that HBoV1 is capable of infecting the lower airways down to at least the bronchioles. 275 HBoV1 DNA is detectable in the serum suggesting dissemination beyond the airway. Likewise, HBoV1 can rarely be detected in stool with and without gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting passive spread from the respiratory to the gastrointestinal tract. 275 In vitro, HBoV1 induces IL-13, IFN-γ and IL-10 in CD4+ T cells. Children with HBoV1-associated bronchiolitis have increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 in nasopharyngeal aspirates.

However, in addition to causing tissue damage or secondary bacterial infections in young vaccinated chicks [25, 26] , live attenuated vaccines of RNA viruses may not be genetically stable or they may be associated with the tendency to revert back to a virulent form [9, 14] . Moreover, the potential for recombination between vaccine and virulent strains can lead to the creation of new virulent virus [27] . Furthermore, it takes a substantial amount of time to prepare a extensively passaged attenuated vaccine strain, which may not be able to effectively solved the loss problem caused by the rapid variation exhibited by prevalent strains on the flocks."

377,1669438,"Face masks have been recommended as a public health nonpharmaceutical intervention against ILI. However, in order for face masks to provide effective protection, the public must possess the correct knowledge for wearing them. In this study, 88.4% of respondents believed that they knew the correct steps for wearing a face mask; however, only 52.0% answered the procedural question correctly. These findings may be due to the fact that face masks have a relatively simple design, which leads many people to assume that they know the correct procedure for use. The low proportion of correct answers may reflect the lack of standard requirements for the packaging of face masks and their designs. In Hong Kong, there are no guidelines for facemask manufacturers to follow. The packaging of many face masks do not include clear instructions. This problem is compounded by the fact that designs for face masks differ between manufacturers. Some face masks have a colored side to indicate which side should face out. However, face masks that are white on both sides also exist. Without proper instructions and knowledge, it is difficult to wear a face mask correctly. In other knowledge items, respondents typically scored high. However, only 53.6% correctly answered 'False' to the statement 'When wearing a face mask in the clinic, there is no need to cover your mouth when sneezing or coughing.' This indicates that respondents did not know that face masks can only act as a barrier for large droplets and not for very small particle aerosols. This misconception could possibly lead to an increase in ILI transmission, as viruses can still be transmitted through the facemask cover. These findings indicate an urgent need for a better public health programme to increase knowledge about the correct wearing of face masks. Attitudes toward the use of face masks were generally positive. Respondents rated nurses and doctors as being good sources for cues to action (85.0% and 81.6%, respectively). On the other hand, only 52.2% indicated that posters would serve as an effective reminder for wearing a face mask. This may be due to the fact that there are numerous posters in the waiting area for various health reminders. In fact, four posters related to the proper use of face masks were found within the clinic area. However, these posters mainly consisted of written instructions, which may be a problem for those who have difficulty reading. In addition, these posters were hidden amongst many other educational materials, which makes it difficult for them to be an effective cue to action."
378,1969107,"A holistic ecological and evolutionary process perspective is required to understand the risk of spillover and spread of pathogens in humans and animals (Alexander et al. 2018 ). Pathogens are not fixed entities, and some pathogens carry a greater innate ability to evolve and spillover into new hosts than others (Johnson et al. 2015; Olival et al. 2017 ). Evaluation of pathogen evolution from initial spillover to establishment in the human population (e.g., simian immunodeficiency virus chimpanzee to human immunodeficiency virus; HIV-1) (Gao et al. 1999 ) is critical to understanding why certain pathogens can establish and others cannot. Viral surveillance in ''real-time'' is required to examine and track pathogen evolution. For example, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, designed to monitor the quickly evolving and recombining influenza virus in a timely manner, has served for over half a century as a global alert mechanism for the emergence of influenza viruses with pandemic potential (World Health Organization 2019a). Knowledge of ecological scenarios surrounding the accelerated viral evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is vital to preparing for future outbreaks of the disease in humans and worthy of significant investment in China and elsewhere (Gao 2018) ."
379,2034995,"Importance of cholesterol and/or lipid rafts during viral entry has been related to different aspects of the viral entry process. Lipid rafts could create a favourable environment around target membrane receptors, facilitating oligomerization of (co)receptors or recognition of (co)receptors by the virus (Burger et al., 2000; Viard et al., 2002) . Another explanation may be that the signal transduction molecules that are particularly concentrated in lipid rafts (Brown, 2006; Brown and London, 1998, 2000; Dykstra et al., 2003; Helms and Zurzolo, 2004; Simons and Toomre, 2000) facilitate specific steps in viral entry, such as penetration or transport of the capsid to the nucleus. E.g., during human herpesvirus 8-entry, lipid rafts have been suggested to be important for modification of signalling molecules, microtubule dynamics and nuclear delivery, but are dispensable for binding and penetration (Raghu et al., 2007) . The importance of lipid rafts can also be due to the requirement for the specific classes of lipids that associate with lipid rafts: cholesterol but also sphingolipids. The concept of lipid recognition by certain proteins might be an important factor in viral entry (Teissier and Pecheur, 2007) . During retroviral entry, specific lipids have an apparent role in conformational changes leading to the proper exposure of the fusion peptide toward the target membrane (Alfsen and Bomsel, 2002; Chazal and Gerlier, 2003) . As membrane curvature mainly depends on the molecular shape of lipids, lipids also play a key role in the membrane deformation that is required for penetration of the plasma membrane (Teissier and Pecheur, 2007) ."

On admission, she was tachypneic with an oxygen saturation of 86% on room air. Initial ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial and ventricular complexes and a prolonged QTc of 528 ms. ECGs from prior admissions demonstrated QTc 500 ms. CXR showed bilateral patchy opacities ( Figure 3A ). Initial laboratory analysis was notable for white blood cell count of 6000 per microliter, creatinine 1.1 mg/d, ferritin of 639 µg/L, CRP of 20 ng/ mL, hs-TropT 42 ng/mL, and NT-pro BNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) 6137 pg/mL. She had no significant bradycardia and was treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics including intravenous azithromycin. She did not receive hydroxychloroquine due to prolonged QTc. She developed refractory hypoxemia requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation on hospital day 2. She developed transient hypotension briefly requiring vasopressor and inotropic support. A premature ventricular complex caused a classic long-short sequence followed by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia requiring multiple defibrillation attempts ( Figure 3B ). ECG demonstrated marked QTc prolongation of 581 ms and marked T wave inversion ( Figure 3C ). Repeat laboratory analysis was notable for serum potassium of 4.2 mmol/L and magnesium 1.4 mg/dL. She was treated with intravenous magnesium, and azithromycin was In this case, we highlight the arrhythmic risk faced among critically ill patients treated with potential COVID therapeutics which have QTc prolonging effects. The patient developed torsades de pointes, likely precipitated by azithromycin in the setting of a baseline prolonged QT interval, which may have been related to previous cardiomyopathy, inherited ion-channel disorders, or possibly the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the heart. Although there are no Food and Drug Administrationapproved therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, the treatment regimen of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin has been widely adopted for all patients with moderate to severe pneumonia with oxygen saturation <90% on room air, based on early limited studies suggesting improved clinical outcomes and viral clearance. [16] [17] [18] Both of these medications are known to prolong the QT interval, and there is concern regarding an elevated risk of arrhythmia, particularly torsades de pointes, with combined therapy. In patients with baseline prolonged QTc intervals, particularly >500 ms, the risks of therapy may outweigh the benefits and should be considered on an individual basis. 19 However, this patient did not receive hydroxychloroquine, and the QTc prolongation may have been due to azithromycin in a patient with low repolarization reserve."
382,2089380,"There are more than 100 candidate COVID-19 vaccines in development, with a handful in, or soon to be in, phase 1 trials to assess safety and immunogenicity. 4 Candidate vaccines encompass diverse platforms that differ in the potency with which immunity is stimulated, the specific arsenal of immune mediators mobilised, the number of required boosts, durability of protection, and tractability of production and supply chains. 3,4 Safety evaluation of candidate COVID-19 vaccines will need to be of the highest rigour. Some features of the immune response induced by infection, such as high concentrations of tumour necrosis factor and interleukin 6, which could be elicited by some candidate vaccines, have been identified as biomarkers of severe outcome. 19 Researchers should be commended for decades of iterative efforts, bringing us to a point where there are many candidate vaccines in development against a novel virus first sequenced in January, 2020. Delivery of efficacious vaccines is not a competitive race to the finish, but a considered evaluation of a safe, potent, global response. 4 Few would disagree that science should guide the clinical therapeutic approach to an infected person. Science must also guide policy decisions.

The RDV method comprises 6 procedures: 1) effective destruction of cellular RNA and DNA for semipurification of viral particles, 2) effective elimination of DNA fragments by using a pre-filtration column system and elution of small amounts of RNA, 3) effective synthesis of first-and second-strand cDNAs, 4) construction and amplification of a cDNA library, 5) construction of a second cDNA library, and 6) direct sequencing using optimized primers. The RDV method enables a broad range of partial nucleotide sequences within the entire viral RNA genome to be obtained within 2 days without cloning into plasmids."
384,2067297,"Viral taxonomy may continue to adjust subjectively to changing times, differing philosophies, and bio-political pressure, yet regardless of the specific etiological names responsible for this disease, the moniker for rabies will remain. Theories on lyssavirus and host co-evolution will be complemented by methodological improvements and pathogen discovery. With enhanced, de-centralized laboratory-based surveillance and focused detection efforts, additional lyssavirus species and host shifts are expected. Stockpiling of vaccine and RIG, attention to existing recommendations, and careful risk assessments will increase the use of pre-exposure vaccination, maximize appropriate use of biologics in those truly exposed, and reduce PEP failures. Eventual application of the growing knowledge base on rabies pathogenetic mechanisms, pronounced intensive clinical skills in managing encephalitis, and the abilities to intervene with combinations of biologics and anti-viral drugs will gradually result in additional rabies survivors in human and veterinary medicine without losing the critical focus upon disease prevention. Ideally, under a progressive global business plan (with the minimum application of estimated biologics to the populations at risk, new champions, and dedicated sponsorships without vaccination fatigue), human rabies mediated by dogs should be eliminated in Latin America over the next 5 years, in Asia within a decade, and in Africa by 2030. Although Table 8 . Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), number and percentages of non-exposed persons receiving PEP per million. eradication is not the aim, given a diversity of wildlife reservoirs and a lack of strategies to break the chain of perpetuation among the Chiroptera, the time is long overdue to accomplish such other ambitious goals against an ancient and insidious but neglected killer."
385,1031591,"Baftizadeh et al. 122 looked in detail at the early stages of fibrillar aggregation in Aβ at residues 35-40 using molecular dynamics. Because the formation of an ordered nucleus is considered a rare event, they opted to use bias-exchange metadynamics, which is beneficial for accelerating rare events. They attempted to investigate the criteria that lead Aβ to a nucleation event. Their results differed from the experimentally observed structure, indicating that the nascent fibril may have a different structure from the extended fibril. Viral IDPs NS3 serine protease activity is essential for processing of hepatitis C virus precursor protein. NS3 is intrinsically disordered, and undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to a structural zinc ion. This binding event is essential for formation of a stable active site and thus protease activity, and this is summarized in a review by Vega et al. 123 This review encompasses various biophysical studies that have led to these findings, as well as development of allosteric modulators of this binding event."
386,2037991,"PEDV RNA was detected in the faeces of all pigs of the InDel and non-InDel trial except for the InDel indirect contact pigs. The PEDV RNA was detected earlier in faeces of the non-InDel trial pigs at 1 dpi compared to 2 ± 0.5 dpi in faeces of InDel inoculated pigs, that is, 1 ± 0.5 days earlier for the non-InDel pigs. Similar results were observed from faeces of direct contact pigs where PEDV RNA was detected in faeces of non-InDel direct contact pigs between 1 and 2 dpi and between 4.5 and 14 dpi in faeces of InDel direct contact pigs, that is, on average 7 days earlier for the non-InDel direct contact pigs. These results suggest the non-InDel PEDV strain replicates more quickly in the target cells and/or demonstrates the ability to propagate to higher levels more quickly in a pig population. The shedding periods were similar for the InDel (except for the indirect contact pigs) and non-InDel strains. The shedding periods for the non-InDel and InDel strains were close to previous observations from other studies which reported shedding periods of 17-23 or 18-20 days on average for the non-InDel (Madson et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2015) and for the InDel strain, respectively (Leidenberger et al., 2017; Lohse et al., 2017) . Two others studies on PEDV InDel strains revealed that pigs inoculated with an InDel strain began to shed virus earlier than in our experimental conditions, that is, shedding began at 1 dpi, and the presence of PEDV RNA in faeces was detected until the pigs were necropsied at 7 dpi (Chen et al., 2016; Yamamoto, Soma, Nakanishi, Yamaguchi, & Niinuma, 2015) . In accordance with the results of other studies (Chen et al., 2016) , the amount of genomic copies in faeces was more important in infected pigs by the non-InDel strain than for those that were infected by the InDel strain whatever the pig status (inoculated, direct contact, indirect contact) in our experimental conditions."
387,2510098,"B ats are of particular interest as reservoirs for potentially emergent pathogens. Because of their abundance, wide distribution, and mobility, bats confer a greater risk for zoonotic transmission than other animals (1) . Bats have long been known as the natural hosts for rabies virus and other lyssaviruses and were more recently identifi ed as the reservoirs for emerging viruses such as Ebola, Hendra, and Nipah virus (reviewed in 1). The search for the animal reservoir of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) led to extensive surveys of coronaviruses in wild and domestic animal populations in China, resulting in the detection of a wide variety of novel bat coronaviruses (Bt-CoVs) (2) (3) (4) (5) . The data suggest that the progenitor of the SARS-CoV, and all other coronaviruses in other animal hosts, originated in bats (4) . Recent reports by Dominguez et al. (6) and Gloza-Rausch et al.

The HRV capsid shell is composed of 60 protomers, each comprising one copy of the viral proteins VP4, VP3, VP2, and VP1. VP1, VP2, and VP3 (each ~30 kDa) are to some extent exposed on the capsid surface, whereas VP4 (~7 kDa) is internalized and associated with viral RNA. Five protomers come together at a point around a fi vefold axis, and this cluster is called the pentamer. The fi vefold axis is circumscribed by a cleft referred to as the ""canyon."" VP1, VP2, and VP3 are each formed by a convoluted set of protein sheets and loops [ 159 ] . The loops protrude beyond the external capsid surface and contain discontinuous antigenic sites. Of the HRV types studied, four neutralizing antibody immunogenic (NIm) regions have been identifi ed on HRV-B14 and HRV-A16: NIm-1A (located in VP1), NIm-1B (VP1), NIm-II (VP2 and VP1), and NIm-III (VP3 and VP1) [ 159 ] . Antigenic sites identifi ed on HRV-A2 are called A, B, and C [ 164 ] . The scope and location of antigenic and immunogenic moieties among the HRV-Cs is unknown.

Three plant rhabdoviruses, NCMV, SCV and RYSV (and the synonymous RTYV) contain a short ORF between the G and L genes (Fig. 2) . The NCMV P9, SCV P6, and RYSV P6 genes are predicted to encode proteins of 52, 68, and 93 amino acids, respectively. They share no identifiable sequence similarities but limited similarity can be identified with other rhabdovirus proteins. The RYSV P6 protein shares 24% sequence identity with the N-terminal 110 amino acids of the SYNV L protein and has limited sequence identity with the NV proteins of novirhabdoviruses (up to 25%) and non-coding regions preceding the L gene in Hendra virus (38.3%) and RABV (36.6%). The SCV P6 and NCMV P9 proteins are moderately basic (pI ∼ 8.9) but RYSV P6 is highly acidic (pI 3.49). The large negative charge of this protein is reminiscent of the acidic N-terminal domain of the RYSV L protein, although they lack sequence similarity. Of the three small proteins, only RYSV P6 has been characterised experimentally (Huang et al., 2003) . P6 is phosphorylated in vitro on both serine and threonine residues. It has also been shown to be associated with virions and may have a structural role but it is present only in low amounts during infection. The function of proteins encoded in this genome position is yet unknown. However, distant similarities of RYSV P6 with the L proteins of RYSV and SYNV may suggest a close evolutionary relationship with L proteins and potentially an ancillary role in rhabdovirus replication."

On the contrary, respiratory viral infections are common already in young infants (12) . The understanding of the link between atopy and respiratory viral infections is likely to give clinically highly relevant information that could help in designing early prevention and treatment strategies for asthma.

401,243952,"Willingness to be vaccinated against a given infectious agent, recognized as a major issue affecting the success of vaccination programs, has been extensively investigated in the psychosociological literature dealing with risk perception and illness representations. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The role of risk perception on vaccination has been largely tested and assessed through a meta-analysis of 34 studies. 7 The authors clearly demonstrated that perceived probability of exposure, susceptibility to and severity of a disease are significantly associated with vaccination behaviour. In the case of influenza pandemic A/H1N1, it was assumed that two main theoretical perspectives would be appropriate to explain willingness to be vaccinated. The first is based on mental representations of the illness demonstrated by the Self-Regulation Model (SRM), 8 as an interactive set of factors predicting behaviour to counteract the disease. The second perspective assumes that the psycho-cognitive factors determining risk perception represent the best predictor of protective behaviour against a health threat. Among different models based on risk perception, the Health Belief Model (HBM) 9 was largely empirically tested and improved upon by introducing feelings as a parallel, intuitive reaction to a threat. 10 The level of risk perception is generally assessed through cognitive factors: the perceived probability of being harmed by the hazard (or the perceived vulnerability to the hazard) and the perceived severity related to the extent of harm caused by the hazard. These factors have been found to interact with what is called the 'experimental system' 11 driven by individual emotions. Among them, the level of worry associated with the threat is believed to influence the cognitive factors. 12, 13 In this article, we tested these two models and investigated socio-cultural characteristics that may be associated with the intention to get vaccinated, such as individual values, worldviews and attitudes. Three main questions are addressed: (i) What factors predict the intentions of individuals to be vaccinated against the A/H1N1v? (ii) Does risk perception of the pandemic influenza A/H1N1 determine vaccination intention? (iii) All things being equal, do people's experiences of seasonal flu play a role in their intention to get vaccinated against A/H1N1v by influencing illness representations?"
402,2968784,"We found that TTV-DNA levels increased rapidly; 1 month after LTx, the levels were already markedly elevated, presumably due to ablation of the functional effector cells of the immune system that normally control the TTV infection [14, 15] . At 3 months post-LTx, the mean TTV-DNA level peaked and then gradually declined, reflecting the gradual moderation of immunosuppressive therapy. Interestingly, the TTV-DNA level was lower in patients who received Cyclosporine treatment, possibly mirroring a different immune modulatory mechanism for Cyclosporine compared with Tacrolimus. Görzer et al. [16] previously suggested that this might be due to Cyclosporine being less efficient as an immunosuppressant. However, we found no association between type of immunosuppressive regimen and acute rejection or other events that would indicate a difference in net immunosuppressive effect. Recently, TTV-DNA has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction after lung transplantation [29] , but in our study this was not included as an outcome."

405,921667,"In fact, recent analysis regarding the behavior of the COVID-19 in China demonstrated a power-law t µ growth of infected cases. 8 The authors found exponents around µ = 2.1 ± 0.3, which do not vary very much for different provinces in China. This suggests that socioeconomic differences, local geography, differences in containment strategies, and heterogeneities essentially affect the value of the exponent µ but not the qualitative behavior. A model of coupled differential equations, which includes quarantine and isolation effects, was used by the authors to match real data. Power-law growths for China were also obtained in another study and a possible relation to fractal kinetics and graph theory is discussed. 9 In line with the above publications, the present work analyzes the time-series evolution of the COVID-19 for the following countries: Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Spain, and the United States of America (USA). In all cases, we observe a power-law increase for the positive detected individuals, where the exponent µ changes for different countries. In addition to the power-law behavior, we also computed the Distance Correlation (DC) 10 between pairs of countries. The DC is able to detect nonlinear correlations between data. 11, 12 We show that power-law data are highly correlated between all analyzed countries. This strongly suggest that government strategies to flatten the power-law growth, valid for one country, can be successfully applied to other countries and continents. Furthermore, a model of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) is proposed and some strategies to flatten the power-law curves are discussed using the numerical simulations."
406,1616698,"The global threat due to the novel coronavirus 2019 infection (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to various ethical challenges in public health, and increasingly more articles are being published in medical journals on ethical issues concerning COVID-19. One major theme concerns the moral distress of balancing the importance of epidemiological surveillance and digital patient tracing with privacy concerns. [1] [2] [3] [4] Given the extraordinary current circumstances, other pressing ethical questions have also been posed, including the following: Which studies should be continued or cancelled? What constitutes an ethical study design and rationale? How should the participant burden=risk be balanced against the benefits of research? Should protocol procedures be limited or modified to ensure participant safety, at the risk of decreasing research integrity? Should we justify a shortcut through a fast-track research review and an expedited submission-review process, with the potential downside of lower research quality and more faulty publications? How should the scientific community avoid jeopardizing the pandemic public health management by the rapid and uncontrolled flood of clinical=epidemiological data dissemination in the media? Should we justify conducting urgently required research in developing countries with more treatment-naïve potential research populations, even though the peak of infection expansion in developed countries has already waned? [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Conventionally, academic journals have been one of the most powerful venues for scholarly discussion. However, since the COVID-19 expansion, the extent to which scholarly journals of epidemiology have served as discussion forums for ethical issues on COVID-19 has become unclear, even though many of the ethical questions noted above would likely be important for epidemiologists as well. Against that backdrop, we conducted a small bibliometric survey on June 11, 2020. Specifically, we performed a database search of PubMed using the constraints of ""COVID-19,"" and ""ethics. Of the 39 published in public health=epidemiological journals, only one was published in an epidemiological journal. 18 Accordingly, our findings suggest that unfortunately, epidemiologist engagement in ethical issues on COVID-19 is minimal at best."

409,1983701,"Rice stripe virus (RSV), a typical member of the genus Tenuvirus, is transmitted mainly by the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus) (SBPH) in a persistent and propagative manner, and can infect many crops, such as rice, wheat, and several other gramineous plants, resulting in a severe loss of grain [1] ; in addition, Sun et al. reported that the virus can also infect Arabidopsis thaliana [2] . The infected plants exhibit typical symptoms, such as alternating yellow and green stripes, curly and drooping leaves, and necrotic lesions [3] . Previous reports indicated that the plant chloroplasts were damaged by excessive accumulation of starch, which was triggered by RSV infection, resulting in alternating yellow and green stripes [4] . Melatonin (N-acetyl-5methoxytryptamine, MT), an amine hormone that was isolated and identified from the pineal gland in the late 1950s, has been revealed to possess a broad spectrum of biological functions in both animals and plants in many studies [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In particular, MT has been considered as a therapeutic indole for combating viral diseases, such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and WNV (West Nile virus) [10] . Consistent with the benefits of MT in immunology and medicine in animals, MT can also induce plant resistance to pathogens, such as Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, Alternaria spp., and Fusarium spp. [11, 12] . However, the detailed mechanisms of MT -triggered plant innate immunity to viruses are elusive. Recently, several studies also indicated the potential involvement of a gaseous signal molecule or plant hormone in the defense response triggered by MT. For example, it was reported that nitric oxide (NO) induced by MT is responsible for disease resistance to Pst DC3000 infection in Arabidopsis [13] . Indeed, the vital role of NO in plant-pathogen interactions has been demonstrated by many studies [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . NO can be produced through the nitrate/nitrite-dependent pathway that is known to be catalyzed by nitrate reductase (NR) [19] and through the L -arginine-dependent pathway that is known to be catalyzed by a mammalian NO synthase (NOS)-like enzyme [20, 21] . Further, Lee et al. found that the disease resistance induced by MT correlates with plant hormones in Pst DC3000 [11, 22] . Thus, these studies may provide a potential mechanism for the effect of MT and NO in plant against other pathogen infections."
410,2437429,"A mysterious aspect, however, involves why it is so transmissible. Here we would like to pose a simple question: what role do aerosols play in transmission of This question is easy to ask but extremely challenging to answer. When an infected individual reports to a hospital there is no way to assess definitively how they were infected. The ""contact-tracing"" performed by epidemiologists carefully tracks who came into ""close contact"" with a patient under investigation, but it cannot tell you how the virus itself was transferred from the contagious person to those whom they infected. There is broad agreement in the infectious disease community about possible modes of respiratory virus transmission between humans (Tellier et al. 2019) . Direct or indirect ""contact"" modes require a susceptible individual to physically touch themselves with, for example, a virus-contaminated hand; ""direct"" indicates that person-to-person contact transfers the virus between infected and susceptible hosts (such as by a handshake), while ""indirect"" implies transmission via a ""fomite,"" which is an object like a hand-rail or paper tissue that has been contaminated with infectious virus. In contrast, airborne transmission may occur by two distinct modes and requires no physical contact between infected and susceptible individuals. During a sneeze or a cough, ""droplet sprays"" of virusladen respiratory tract fluid, typically greater than 5 mm in diameter, impact directly on a susceptible individual. Alternatively, a susceptible person can inhale microscopic aerosol particles consisting of the residual solid components of evaporated respiratory droplets, which are tiny enough (<5 mm) to remain airborne for hours."
411,3124906,"The enhancement was accomplished by fusing open reading frames (ORFs) to the N terminus of the EMCV polyprotein coding region, thus utilizing its highly efficient translation initiation site. Expression vectors were constructed to allow cloning in all three reading frames. As reporter genes, we used the IucZ gene and a number of genes encoding coronavirus structural proteins: among others the genes encoding glycoproteins with N-terminal signal sequences. The signal sequences of these glycoproteins are located internally in the primary translation product. We demonstrated that this did not interfere with translocation and glycosylation and yields biologically active proteins. The usefulness of sequences that direct internal initiation was extended by using EMCV UTR s to express two and three ORFs from polycistronic mRNAs."

413,1984810,"Autophagy maintains cellular organelle homeostasis by clearing cellular waste and providing the cell with a supply of energy when nutrients are scarce (18) . Autophagy also functions as the first line of defense to cleanse the cell of invading pathogens such as viruses, and plays an important role in mediating the innate immune response (19) . The activation of autophagy engulfs virions inside host cells via the formation of autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with acidic lysosomes to form autolysosomes through a pH-dependent mechanism. The autolysosomal contents are then degraded by the lysosomal hydrolases. This entire autophagy cycle is called autophagic flux and plays a key role in processing invading viruses. In Drosophila, for example, NF-kB activation during Zika virus infection leads to elevated levels of Drosophila stimulator of interferon genes and increased autophagy in the brain (20) . Unfortunately, some viruses have developed mechanisms to escape autophagy (21) , avoid the immune response (22) , and hijack the autophagosomes for viral replication (23, 24) . Viral hijacking of the endocytic pathway for viral entry and utilization of the autophagic machinery for their replication has been reported (24, 25) . However, some conflicting data has demonstrated that SARS-CoV replication is independent of autophagic mechanisms (26) ."
414,1628406,"In addition to its role in tissue tropism, the S1 glycoprotein also has an important function in inducing a neutralizing antibody response [64, 65] , and small differences in the S1 contribute to poor cross protectionby neutralization test [64, 66] . To evaluate the protective efficacy of this candidate vaccine, we selected the QX-like virulent rIBYZ strain to infect chickens at 14 dpv that were vaccinated with either the rH120-S1/YZ strain or rH120 strain. We found that little protection against rIBYZ virulent strain challenge in the rH120 vaccinated group was induced, with a 50% survival rate and severe clinical symptoms associated with IB. This finding could be explained by differences in the antigenicity between rH120 and rIBYZ. No death, clinical signs, or lesions were observed in the rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated group, indicating that this strain could provide effective protection against rIBYZ challenge in young chickens. Since high humoral antibody titers can contribute to reduced viral replication in various organs and disease recovery [67, 68] , the level of specific IgG antibodies remains an important standard for evaluating the immune response to an IBV vaccine. In the present study, the humoral antibody level of chickens vaccinated with the rH120-S1/YZ strain was observed to gradually increase compared to the non-vaccinated group. However, although the rH120 strain was able to induce similar levels of humoral antibodies, it provided poor protection against rIBYZ, suggesting that protection against IBV infection is not only with humoral immunity, but also with both mucosal immunity combined with the local tracheal and cellular immune response [69] [70] [71] [72] . Thus, the detection of mucosal and cellular immunity in rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated animals requires further exploration. Nevertheless, some studies have shown that a peptide located near the amino terminal end of S2 can be recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [73] , and the S2 domain also plays an important role in inducing protective immunity [28, 61, 74] . Because the S2 domain plays an important role in cell tropism [57] , we also considered that expressing the S1 subunit would provide greater safety than the entire S gene, which could lead to further destruction in some organs of the vaccinated chickens; however, further experiments are required."
415,1624101,"After some patients admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) at the Infectious Disease Department of L. Sacco Hospital in Milan, Italy, complained of olfactory and taste disorders (OTDs), we performed a cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of these alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On 19 March 2020, a simple questionnaire including questions about the presence or absence of OTDs, their type and time of onset respective to hospitalization were submitted through verbal interview to all SARS-CoV-2positive hospitalized patients who were able to give informed consent. Of 88 hospitalized patients, 59 were able to be interviewed (29 were nonrespondents, of whom 4 had dementia, 2 had a linguistic barrier, and 23 were on noninvasive ventilation) ( Table 1) . Of these, 20 (33.9%) reported at least 1 taste or olfactory disorder and 11 (18.6%) both. Twelve patients (20.3%) presented the symptoms before the hospital admission, whereas 8 (13.5%) experienced the symptoms during the hospital stay. Taste alterations were more frequently (91%) before hospitalization, whereas after hospitalization taste and olfactory alteration appeared with equal frequency. Females reported OTDs more frequently than males Olfactory and taste disorders are well known to be related with a wide range of viral infections [4, 5] . SARS-CoV has demonstrated in a mice model a transneural penetration through the olfactory bulb [6] . Moreover, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 receptor, which is used by SARS-CoV-2 to bind and penetrate into the cell, is widely expressed on the epithelial cells of the mucosa of the oral cavity [7] . These findings could explain the underlying pathogenetic mechanism of taste and olfactory disorders in SARS-CoV-2 infection."
416,2887233,"Evidence of abnormal coagulation parameters associated with COVID-19 appeared in early reports from China. Baseline characteristics of the first 99 patients hospitalized in Wuhan found that 6% had an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 5% elevated prothrombin (PT), 36% elevated D-dimer, and increased biomarkers of inflammation including interleukin-6 (IL-6), erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. 18 Thrombocytopenia occurred in only 12%, however, 5 patients had other coinfections (1 bacterial, 4 fungal), and 4 had septic shock. 18 Additional reports from another Wuhan hospital on the first 138 patients found minimal elevations in PT and normal aPTT. 19 Of the patients requiring ICU admission, 26% had higher D-dimer levels and 9% had shock. A complete set of clinical laboratory parameters for the hospital course was available for 33 patients who either recovered or died. Characteristics of the 5 nonsurvivors compared with the 28 survivors included rising D-dimer, progressive lymphopenia, and renal dysfunction. D-dimer levels appeared to diverge 5 days after onset of symptoms. 19 In an analysis of 191 patients from 2 of the main Wuhan hospitals, mortality was reported to be 28% (54 patients). 20 Factors associated with mortality included an elevated D-dimer .1.0 mg/mL on admission, increased PT, elevations in IL-6, and other biomarkers of inflammation, elevated troponin levels, and comorbidities including older age, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. All 54 nonsurvivors met the definition of sepsis, and 50% had evidence of coagulopathy defined as a 3-second PT increase or a 5-second increase in aPTT. Onehalf of these patients also had secondary infections, however, DIC was not assessed. In a multivariable logistic regression model of 171 patients with complete data for all variables (53 nonsurvivors and 118 survivors), a D-dimer level .1.0 mg/mL at admission was associated with increased mortality with an odds ratio of 18.42 (2.64-128.55; P 5 .003). 20 Another early publication evaluated 1099 COVID-19 patients, and excluded individuals who did not require hospitalization. 21 The primary composite outcome of ICU admission, ventilator support, or death occurred in 6.1% (67 patients), with a 1.4% mortality (15 patients) . The investigators noted that compromised respiratory status and more severe disease on admission were associated with worse outcomes. Of the 173 patients who were classified with severe pneumonia at admission, based on the American Thoracic Society criteria, 24.9% (43 of 173) experienced a primary outcome event compared with 3.6% in the nonsevere group. 22 D-dimer was dichotomized as either ,0.5 mg/L or .0.5 mg/L, with more patients with severe disease experiencing a primary outcome having D-dimer values .0.5 mg/L. 22 A more complete assessment of coagulation parameters, including D-dimer, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and antithrombin, in 183 COVID-19 1 patients was analyzed by survivor status from admission through 14 days. 15 At the time of publication, 78 patients (42.6%) had been discharged and 21 patients (11.5%) had died; the rest 84 (45.9%) were still hospitalized. A total of 15 of 21 nonsurvivors were diagnosed with overt DIC according to ISTH criteria, with median onset at 4 days (1-12 days) after admission; only 1 of the 78 discharged patients had evidence of DIC. Over their hospitalization, nonsurvivors had evidence of progressive DIC with decreased fibrinogen, increased D-dimer, and increased PT, occurring 10 days after admission, although information regarding evidence of sepsis was not provided. Although antithrombin levels decreased late in the hospitalization for nonsurvivors, levels were not below normal in the majority. 15 In an analysis of 449 patients classified as having severe COVID-19 (defined as respiratory rate .30 breaths/min, room air oxygen saturation ,93%, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ,300 mm Hg), 99 patients (22%) received prophylactic venous thromboembolism (VTE) anticoagulation for at least 7 days, with 94 patients treated with enoxaparin 40 to 60 mg per day, and 5 treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) 10 000 to 15 000 U per day. 16 Of the 449 patients, 22% (n 5 97) had an ISTH SIC score of $4, and 29.8% of patients (134) had died at the time of reporting. Although no difference in 28-day mortality was seen between heparin-and nonheparin-treated patients overall, stratification by SIC score identified lower mortality in patients treated with heparin when the SIC score was $4 (40.0% vs 64.2%; P 5 .029) compared with a SIC score ,4 (29.0% vs 22.6%; P 5 .419). A 20% reduction in mortality was observed when patients with D-dimer exceeding 3.0 mg/mL were treated with prophylactic doses of heparin (32.8% vs 52.4%; P 5 .017) Even using the SIC score, only 21.6% of severe cases met SIC criteria. However, patients with D-dimer .6 times the upper limit of normal did comprise a higher proportion of severe cases (161 of 446; 35.9%). 16 "

418,748201,"Within the global infection control community, there is an ongoing controversy about the appropriate treatment of inanimate surfaces in hospitals in order to prevent transmission of nosocomial pathogens within an institution. Based on a lack of epidemiological data that would provide evidence of a benefit for the patient from surface disinfection (e.g., from a significant reduction of nosocomial infection rates), some scientists postulate that cleaning of surfaces with non-antimicrobial detergents is generally sufficient [1] . Others prefer cleaning of surfaces with antimicrobial agents, based on data on the risk of infection due to microbial contamination and potential transmission of nosocomial pathogens, at least in the immediate vicinity of patients [2] [3] [4] ."
419,2947582,"The extent of involvement of each abnormality was assessed independently for each of 3 zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below the carina and above the inferior pulmonary vein), and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein). The location of the lesion was defined as peripheral if it was in the outer one-third of the lung, or as central otherwise. The radiographic and CT findings were graded on a 3-point scale: 1 as normal attenuation, 2 as ground-glass attenuation, and 3 as consolidation. The CT scans were scored on the axial images. The ground-glass attenuation and consolidation areas were determined using the method described by Grieser et al [9] . The Hounsfield Units (HU) of normal attenuation, ground-glass attenuation and consolidation areas were measured. Each lung zone, with a total of six lung zones in each patient, was assigned a following scale according to distribution of the affected lung parenchyma using a method modified from a previously described protocol [10] : 0 as normal, 1 as ,25% abnormality, 2 as 25-50% abnormality, 3 as 50-75% abnormality, and 4 as .75% abnormality. The four-point scale of the lung parenchyma distribution was then multiplied by the radiologic scale described above (Figure 1 ). Points from all zones were added for a final total cumulative score, with value ranging from 0 to 72."
420,3,"MERS-CoV infection so far has been described in 10 countries in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon, Iran), 6 countries in Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands), 2 country in Africa (Tunisia, Algeria), 2 countries in Asia (Malaysia, the Philippines), and 1 county in the Americas (United States). 10 Molecular analyses of MERS-CoV or similar viruses from bats and camels suggest that these 2 species are the natural reservoirs of the virus. 11, 12 Whole genome sequencing showed that human and camel viruses from Saudi Arabia are indistinguishable. 12 Multiple transmission routes are suspected; however, their exact contribution has not been elucidated so far. A phylogenetic study of 21 MERS-CoV genomes from Saudi Arabia suggested that both humanto-human transmission and sporadic zoonotic events occur. 13 The stability of the virus for prolonged periods in camel milk suggests the potential of excretion of the virus into camel milk and spread through consuming raw milk. 14 The upsurge of cases since mid-March in the Arabian Peninsula (mainly in Saudi Arabia) is possibly attributed to an increase in the number of primary cases and hospital-acquired cases, some as a part of mainly small (1-2 cases), but in a few instances large, outbreaks. 8 A change in the transmissibility pattern of the virus and increased efficacy for sustained transmission could facilitate inhospital transmission; however, epidemiologic and molecular data to this effect do not exist. Family clusters of MERS-CoV have been recorded. 15 The secondary attack rate in families was 1.35% in Saudi Arabia in 2014. 8 Among imported travel-associated cases, very few instances of person-to-person transmission have been verified. [16] [17] [18] Recent phylogenetic analysis using human sequences from Jeddah suggests that the virus has not changed from previous strains. 8 Overall, it seems unlikely that the virus has increased its transmissibility or patterns of transmission. The basic reproductive number has been estimated to be <1 using real-time data until June and August 2013, respectively, 19,20 even though the upper range of estimates exceeded 1 in a scenario where infection control was not implemented. 20 These findings indicate no pandemic potential for MERS-CoV so far. Recently, a committee appointed by the WHO concluded that the conditions for a public health emergency of international concern have not yet been met. Moreover, increased testing rates of less ill or asymptomatic cases may have contributed to the upsurge of detected cases."

We identified baricitinib, which is predicted to reduce the ability of the virus to infect lung cells."
422,920777,"China has made great contributions to the control of pulmonary infections, in particular concerning a couple of new pulmonary viral diseases, causative of a pandemic, great financial loss and social panic. In the year 2003, Nanshan Zhong (Guangzhou Medical College) and other researchers isolated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) in Guangdong. They demonstrated SARS CoV was responsible for the epidemic outbreak and the prototypical SARS-CoV strain found in other countries (2) . Zhong also proposed corticosteroid treatment for critical SARS and confirmed proper corticosteroid use decreased mortality and hospital stay, and was not significantly associated with secondary lower respiratory infection or other severe complications (3, 4) . Further studies revealed detectable persistence of IgG antibodies and neutralizing viral antibodies for up to 720 days. (5) . In a rhesus macaque model, potent siRNA inhibitors of SARS-CoV provided relief from fever, diminished viral levels and reduced acute diffuse alveoli damage (6) . The group of Chengyu Jiang (Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CAMS) reported the entry of SARS-CoV into cells was mediated by a heparin sulfate proteoglycans-mediated, but clathrin-and caveolae-independent mechanism (7, 8) . Zhengli Shi (Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS) and coworkers reported whole-genome sequences of two novel bat CoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses were far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat CoVs, particularly in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Most importantly, they found the first recorded isolation of a live SARSlike-CoV strain, with typical CoV morphology sharing 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367, utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cellular entry. These results provide the strongest evidence that Chinese horseshoe bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV (9). The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) causes severe pulmonary disease in humans, representing the second example of a highly pathogenic CoV. Fu Gao (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, CCDC) delineated the specific interaction between the free RBD of the MERS-CoV spike protein and CD26, the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV (10) . Chuan Qin (CAMS) developed rhesus macaques as a model for MERS-CoV. The infected monkeys exhibited clinical signs of disease, viral replication, histological lesions and produced neutralizing antibody (11) . Taijiao Jiang (CAS) developed a new computational method PREDAC, predicting antigenic clusters of H3N2 influenza virus with high accuracy from viral hemagglutinin (HA) sequences. The coupling of large-scale HA sequencing with PREDAC can significantly improve vaccine strain recommendation (12) . Jiang's work provides an urgently needed tool for rapid and large-scale analysis of HA receptor specificities for global influenza surveillance. The group of Chengyu Jiang found autophagic cell death of alveolar epithelial cells plays a crucial role in the high mortality rate of H5N1 infection, and autophagy-blocking agents might be useful against H5N1-induced lung injury (13). IL-17 Monoclonal antibodies were reported to be potential treatment agent for H1N1virus (14) . Hongyan Wang (CAS) and coworkers first demonstrated that adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP) regulates the positive feedback loop of TGF-b1 production and TGF-b1-induced CD103 expression in CD8 1 T cells via the TbRI-TRAF6-TAK1-SMAD3 pathway and protects from influenza virus (i.e. H5N1 or H1N1) infection (15) . Chen Wang (Capital Medical University) and coworkers reported oseltamivir and maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, alone and in combination, reduced time to fever resolution in H1N1 patients (16) . During an influenza pandemic in mainland of China in 2013, Yuelong Shu (CCDC) and coworkers reported isolation of a novel re-assortment of avian-origin influenza A virus, identified as H7N9. Further sequencing analyses revealed, all gene segments from the virus were of avian origin (17) . Lanjuan Li (Zhejiang University)'s team found a similar viral isolate from patients and epidemiologically linked market chickens. The H7 of the isolated viruses was closest to that of the H7N3 virus from domestic ducks in Zhejiang, whereas the N9 was closest to that of the wild bird H7N9 virus in South Korea. Gln226Leu and Gly186Val substitutions in human virus H7 and the PB2 Asp701Asn mutation were identified (18) . Hualan Chen (Gansu Agricultural University) and coworkers systematically analyzed H7N9 viruses isolated from birds and humans. They determined viruses isolated from birds were nonpathogenic in chickens, ducks and mice, but viruses isolated from humans caused up to 30% body weight loss in mice. One virus isolated from humans was highly transmissible in ferrets by respiratory droplet (19) . Chuan Qin also reported that H7N9 virus was capable of transmission between ferrets via low level respiratory droplets. Four mutations were further identified in the virus isolated from the contact ferret (20) . Fu Gao had evaluated the viral HA receptor-binding properties of two human H7N9 isolates and found that SH-H7N9 HA preferentially binds the avian receptor analog, whereas AH-H7N9 HA binds both avian and human receptor analogs. Furthermore, an AH-H7N9 mutant HA (Leu226!Gln) exhibited dual receptor-binding properties, which indicated AH-H7N9 can bind human receptors while retaining avian receptor-binding properties (21) . The prognosis of H7N9 infection is poor. Lanjuan Li and coworkers performed a comprehensive study to identify prognostic factors for H7N9, and found chronic heart disease was associated with increased hospitalization risk (22) . The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II in H7N9 patients are associated with disease severity and mortality. Moreover, the predictive value of angiotensin II is greater than that of C-reactive protein, and some clinical parameters such asPaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (23) . A national monitoring network in China for emergent infections, established after the SARS crisis in 2003, was crucial to timely prevention and treatment of the H7N9 infection."
423,2039581,"FCoV antibody titers when accurately performed are thought to be of some value in distinguishing enteric infection from FIP. Cats with IFA titers ≥1:3200 are highly suggestive of FIP [31] . In our study using the serotyping method established, type-specific FCoV antibody could be titrated and the titer in some of our FIP cats reached relatively high level as well (≥1:1600). Our recent study revealed that the infection of serotype II FCoV correlated significantly with the occurrence of FIP [16] . Also horizontal transmission of a serotype II virus was clearly demonstrated to responsible for a FIP outbreak [29] . Continuous survey of the antibodies against two serotype of FCoV, especially in the multi-cat environment could help in identifying the invasion of any type II FCoV hence isolating the animals to prevent future FIP occurrence."
424,531611,"Susceptibility to SARS coronavirus S protein-driven infection correlates with expression of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and infection can be blocked by soluble receptor A novel coronavirus (CoV) has been identified as the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] [2] [3] . The SARS associated CoV (SARS-CoV) exhibits a genome organization similar to those of known CoVs [4] [5] [6] , however, sequence analysis indicates that SARS-CoV does not cluster with known coronaviruses, but either constitutes a new branch [4, 5] or a subgroup of class II CoVs [7, 8] . Recent reports demonstrated that the spike protein (S) of SARS-CoV is sufficient to drive infection of cells and can be recognized by neutralizing antibodies in SARS patients [9] [10] [11] . Because of its essential role in viral entry, SARS-CoV S is an attractive target for vaccines and antiviral compounds. Indeed, immunization of mice with a S-based DNA vaccine triggered humoral and cellular immune responses and protected animals from SARS-CoV infection [12] . Moreover, a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV S has been shown to potently inhibit SARS-CoV infection and could be employed for first line therapy [13] ."

Although CIP and CIM share many features on nerve conduction studies and electromyography, differentiation is possible in ideal circumstances, particularly when the patient is cooperative and voluntary muscle activation is possible (Table 3 ) [2, 5, 6, 22, 30, 42] . Single nerve conduction studies have shown promise as alternative for time-consuming full electrophysiological studies [22, 31, 32] . For differential diagnosis of CIP and CIM in uncooperative patients, direct muscle stimulation shows normal muscle excitability in CIP and reduced muscle excitability in CIM. However, expertise is not widely available and differential diagnosis is further complicated by the high co-occurrence of CIP and CIM."

Virucidal efficacy has in some cases been determined to occur within 15 s of contact. Following a hand simulation study with the murine norovirus, it was found that hand washing with PVP-I was more effective than chlorhexidine and soft soap, a gold standard recommended by the WHO. PVP-I was also shown to be more virucidal against both enterovirus and coxsackievirus when compared to other disinfectants. The need to develop potent antiviral formulations suitable for widespread use has been brought to prominence by the emergence of rapid viral outbreaks over the past decade, many of which have been coronaviruses. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a single-stranded RNA virus first identified during an outbreak in 2012 that eventually spread to 21 countries worldwide, triggering mass media coverage [24] . To date, the virus remains categorised as a high biosafety risk, with containment remaining the primary measure to combat outbreaks, as no vaccines or specific antiviral treatments have yet been developed. However, randomised controlled clinical trials have shown that PVP-I and alcohol-based hand rubs are more effective than soap-based hand washes for hand hygiene in the presence of such transmissible viruses [16] ."
430,1200088,"HA activity of calf coronavirus is destroyed by ether and chloroform, but not by deoxycholate or neuroaminidase, and is retained in heat-inactivated viral preparations. 71 The calf coronavirus replicates entirely in the cytoplasm, with budding into cytoplasmic vesicles, like most coronavirus, and produces syncytial cells in infected cell cultures. 49 ,71 The calf coronavirus contains a single plus-stranded polyadenylated infectious RNA of a moelcular weight in the order of 5.0 to 8.0 X 1()6 daltons. 26 The calf coronavirus contains five polypeptides of molecular weight' in the range of 26 to 140 X 10 3 daltons. 34 Calf coronavirus can be propagated in a variety of cells, 13,49,71,83 and its replication is enhanced by trypsin.83 All bovine coronaviruses appear to be of the same serotype. The calf coronavirus is serologically related to other coronaviruses, including mouse hepatitis virus type 3 and human coronavirus strain OC 43, and to the hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus of swine. However, it is not serologically related to the human coronavirus strain 229E, canine coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, or feline infectious peritonitis virus. 24,61,67 Antibodies to calf coronavirus have been found in a variety of animal species, including humans. 68 Some isolates of calf coronaviruses can be experimentally pathogenic for mice producing encephalitis. 35 Coronaviruses associated with neonatal calf diarrhea have worldwide distribution. 10 The prevalence of antibodies to the calf coronavirus is high in the cattle population, closer to 100 per cent. 65 Morbidity of coronavirus enteritis has been estimated at 15 to 25 per cent,36 with mortality rates of 5 to 10 per cent in uncomplicated coronavirus infections. Mortality rates are significantly higher in cases of secondary viral or bacterial infections, especially those of enteropathogenic E. coli. 31 Most cases of coronavirus diarrhea are observed in calves 5 to 20 days of age,11,36,49 but epizootics of coronaviral diarrhea have been reported in adult cattle. 79 There is evidence that strains of calf coronavirus can infect the bovine respiratory tract. 63 "
431,2512364,"Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and lymphocyte-to-C-reactive protein ratio in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A meta-analysis Despite several reports describing increased levels of neutrophils and C-reactive protein along with a decrease in lymphocyte numbers in patients with COVID-19, 2,6-10 until now, very few reports have considered the cost-effective markers NLR and LCR to aid complication predictions. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is a type of respiratory failure characterized by a rapid onset of generalized inflammation in the lungs, is the leading cause of mortality of patients with COVID-19. Thus, increased NLR levels and low LCR levels reflecting an enhanced inflammatory process may suggest a poor prognosis."
432,899762,"Molecular imaging has the potential to complement traditional radiographic methods, by characterizing pathophysiologic processes that underly pulmonary structural changes and impaired respiratory function during the course of illness. SPECT, PET, MRI, and BLI offer molecular imaging techniques that could potentiate the discovery of new biomarkers for predicting disease progression and supporting the development of novel therapies targeting viral replication or damaging host responses. Although new diseases, such as novel H1N1 influenza and SARS, will inevitably continue to emerge, molecular imaging can help to reduce their impact on public health by elucidating their pathogenetic mechanisms.

434,1111195,"One of the intriguing characteristics of the 2003 SARS epidemic was the occurrence of superspreading events. It was estimated that 71.1% and 74.8% of the infections were attributable to superspreading events in Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively [3] . The vast majority of documented superspreading events occurred in hospitals, with few exceptions (e.g., the Amoy Gardens [4] ), but the underlying causes of such events have not been well studied. The World Health Organization [5] attributed the superspreading phenomenon to the lack of stringent infection-control measures in hospitals during the early days of the epidemic. Shen et al. [6] identified 4 superspreading events in Beijing and found that the index patients were likely to have been older and had a higher case-fatality rate and a larger number of close contacts. Other previous studies either focused on the analysis of risk factors at the individual level, among affected health care workers [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] or inpatients [12] , or were simply anecdotal reports based on personal observations and speculations [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . To better understand why such nosocomial outbreaks occurred and to provide guidance for the prevention of superspreading events of SARS and similar infectious diseases in the future, we performed a systematic analysis of the risk factors associated with nosocomial outbreaks of SARS in hospital wards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong."
435,1981869,"A prospective multicenter case-control study evaluated the use of convalescent plasma for severe influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (Hung et al., 2011) . Ninety-three participants that had clinical deterioration despite optimal antiviral treatment and that required intensive care were enrolled. All subjects were offered immune plasma, with a neutralizing antibody titer of > 1:160. The 20 participants that accepted the plasma were compared to the 73 subjects that did not accept the plasma. Mortality was 20% in the group that accepted the plasma vs 54% in those that declined. The control arm mortality was higher than anticipated for a similar severity of illness (Duggal et al., 2016) . However, the authors concluded that plasma was effective in reducing mortality, respiratory tract viral load, and serum cytokine levels in the treatment group."
436,2039655,"Regarding SARS-CoV-2 ELISA using S1 protein epitopes, several pilot studies report positive results with sera from patients with SARS-CoV-1, and a lack of significant cross-reactivity when using sera from small numbers of patients seropositive for the endemic human coronaviruses (18, 44) . Data regarding SARS-CoV-2 ELISA based on the N protein are more limited. The specificity of 2 ELISA and 10 lateral flow assays has also been assessed against 108 pre-COVID-19 sera from U.S. patients collected in July 2018, and ranged from 84.3 to 100% (41). Finally, in keeping with these results, a surrogate assay of SARS-CoV-2 viral neutralization tests was found to be highly specific among sera positive for endemic human coronaviruses antibodies but showed some degree of cross reactivity with SARS-CoV-1 positive sera (28) . Thus, cross reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 serologic assays may be a concern in areas where SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV circulated widely. Overall, serologic tests based on S protein appear to distinguish between emerging and endemic coronaviruses. Assays based on the N protein can serve as a marker of recent infection but might be expected to cross react more with endemic coronaviruses."
437,1819635,"It must be emphasized that treating the host response would not prevent or cure Ebola virus infection itself, but it might allow individual patients to survive long enough to develop an immune response that eliminates the virus. These agents could be used in combination with antivirals if they are available."
438,1628450,"Although several rodents and other small mammals are known as important reservoirs for many viruses, bats (order: Chiroptera) represent the vast majority of identified natural reservoirs of several virus families/species to date [1, 14] . For example, bats are known reservoirs for a growing list of RNA viruses, including rabies virus and other lyssaviruses, henipaviruses, coronaviruses and ebola virus [15] . Virus infections in bats follow the typical pattern of reservoirs with a persistent course lacking clinical disease [1, 16] . Several biological characteristics including gregariousness with large colonies, seasonal migrating and long life span make bats suitable to carry and spread viruses [16] . Seasonal migrating and wide hunting territories of bats can lead to wide distribution of harboured viruses [1] , however, shedding in pulses and additional local factors can lead to local transmission events [16] . In Europe, 35 bat species from the order Chiroptera can be found [17] . These European bats share the same biological characteristics, but transmission events of zoonotic viruses are rare due to smaller dimensions of populations and colonies [18] . In Germany, 25 bat species can be encountered from the family Rhinolophidae and Vespertilionidae [19] . They include common native species, such as members of the genera Pipistrellus, Myotis and Vespertilio, and some seriously endangered species like Rhinolophus hipposideros, Myotis emarginatus and Barbastella barbastellus [19] ."
439,1040070,"As a proof of concept for the therapeutic or prophylactic approach of convalescent plasma for MERS CoV, MERS-CoV-neutralizing serum from Egyptian dromedary camels naturally infected with MERS-CoV was transferred to IFNAR -/mice transduced with an adenovirus expressing human DPP4 (Ad5-hDPP4) and inoculated with MERS-CoV, resulting in reduced weight loss and lung pathology in treated animals compared to controls . Polyclonal immunoglobulin preparations from the plasma of transchromosomal cows or horses vaccinated against MERS-CoV were also effective in reducing lung virus titers when administered to Ad5-hDPP4 mice one day after inoculation with MERS-CoV Zhao et al., 2017) . However, despite promising results in mouse models, the high case-fatality rate in humans, low neutralizing antibody titers in survivors and the inability of many survivors to function as plasma donors due to underlying health issues are considerable hurdles in the implementation of convalescent plasma therapy for MERS patients (Arabi et al., 2016) . Monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment could provide an alternative for convalescent plasma, and several neutralizing monoclonal antibodies have been developed and tested in animal models (Agrawal et al., 2016;  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.06.006 Received 2 April 2018; Received in revised form 4 June 2018; Accepted 5 June 2018 Corti et al., 2015; Houser et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016; Li et al., 2015; Pascal et al., 2015; Qiu et al., 2016) . REGN3051 and REGN3048 are two fully human, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that bind to previously described distinct epitopes in the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein (Pascal et al., 2015) . Treatment of mice expressing human DPP4 under control of the mouse DPP4-regulatory elements with 200 μg of either REGN3048 or REGN3051 24hrs before inoculation with MERS-CoV significantly reduced virus titers in the lungs; similarly, treatment of mice with 500 μg REGN3051 24hrs after inoculation with MERS-CoV also reduced virus titers in the lungs. Inoculation of common marmosets with MERS-CoV results in coalescing bronchointerstitial pneumonia with clear signs of respiratory disease that may require euthanasia (Chan et al., 2015; Falzarano et al., 2014) . Here, we evaluated the ability of the human, neutralizing mAbs REGN3048 and REGN3051 to reduce disease severity and virus replication in the lungs of common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV upon prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. In this model, there was a clear clinical benefit upon prophylactic treatment with mAb; however, the effect of therapeutic mAb treatment on the disease course was limited."
440,2039659,"In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, among the binding antibodies to the different regions of the S protein (S1, S2, RBD), RBD-specific IgG correlated best with nAbs, suggesting that RBD is be a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates (24) . However, because RBD is the most variable region of the genome (86) , there is still a theoretical risk for immunologic ""escape,"" as well as immune enhancement development (87) . The N protein, a more conserved region of the genome, has been of interest for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates and was thought to be at lower risk for immune enhancement; however, it was not shown to elicit nAbs (82) . The role of the N protein in SARS-CoV-2 immune response is still unknown."
441,916371,"Pilgrims' knowledge, attitude, and practice are regarded to have a significant influence on the understanding of uptake of preventive measures and bridging the gap towards delivering of health information [11, 12] . The gap in knowledge, as well as the poor attitudes and bad practices in relation to disease prevention and control, contribute to the increased risk of infection and negative impacts during mass gatherings [13] . The assessment of pilgrims KAP towards respiratory tract infections and their preparedness have received considerable attention from many researchers from different countries across the globe [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . To ensure effective preventive practice and optimum preparedness regarding respiratory tract infection prevention during Hajj and Umrah, data on pilgrims' knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices (KAP) are required. This information would be significant in providing the needed strategies to be implemented. Moreover, these would enhance and evaluate the presently available programs as well as recognize possible interventions to improve the behavioral and attitudinal changes. Positive attitude and behavioral changes are driven by the level of knowledge and perceptions towards preventive practices [19] . However, there is no study conducted in Malaysia to assess the KAP of both Umrah and Hajj pilgrims. Therefore, this study is aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practice regarding the prevention of respiratory tract infection and to explore the relationship between the demographic variables and knowledge, attitude and practice scores among 2018 Malaysian Hajj and Umrah pilgrims."
442,3129622,"The presence of maternal antibodies protected suckling C57BL/6 mice from the clinical manifestations of the acute encephalomyelitis caused by mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM), a coronavirus, even though histological evidence of encephalomyelitis was found at early times after inoculation . 100% of infected suckling mice developed a fatal disease in the absence of maternal antibody . By 14 days after inoculation, the brains of all antibody-protected mice examined were nearly normal on histological examination . At 3-8 weeks post-inoculation, approximately 40% of the antibody-protected mice developed a neurological disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis and wasting . Evidence of inflammation and demyelination was apparent in the spinal cord and brainstem . The mice that remained asymptomatic at this time showed few signs of inflammation and none developed clinical disease over the following 9 months. Viral antigen could be detected in most of the mice examined at all times after inoculation, whether symptomatic or not, and was particularly evident in the animals with hindlimb paralysis . MHV-JHM could be consistently cultured from the mice with hindlimb paralysis . These results show that maternal immune factors can completely protect susceptible mice from the acute, fatal, clinical encephalomyelitis caused by MHV-JHM, but cannot prevent the establishment of a latent state and subsequent development of virus-induced, clinically evident, demyelinating disease . This model will be useful for studying the virus and host factors important for the development of MHV-JHM latency and subsequent virus-induced demyelination ."

Based on a previous pig study [36] , fecal virus shedding could be detected but no microscopic lesions or IHC staining could be observed in early stage of infection. In this study, the virus was undetected in rectal swabs of YN144 group although IHC staining was observed in YN144 group. This is because viruses are colonized in intestinal epithelial cells. If the intestinal epithelial cells are not destroyed, the viruses cannot be released from intestinal epithelial cells into feces and they cannot be detected by RT-PCR. The YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain which cannot cause the damage of the intestinal epithelial cells, so YN144 could not be detected from fecal samples, although their presence can be shown in the IHC results."

448,2864492,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has affected over 8 400 people worldwide, with most cases in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HK SAR), Singapore and Canada. 1 The largest outbreak worldwide has occurred in Beijing, China with over 2 500 cases. The causative agent is a novel coronavirus, which has not been detected previously in human populations. It has been isolated in culture and detected by electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from a range of clinical specimens. In addition, serological evidence of infection has been found in most patients fitting the clinical definition of SARS, although antibody responses may be slow to develop. [2] [3] [4] [5] The genome of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been sequenced from multiple clinical isolates. 6 SARS is fatal in at least 10% of cases, with a higher mortality in the elderly or where the person has underlying diabetes, heart or lung disease, or impaired immunity. 5, 7, 8 An understanding of the pathogenesis and histopathological features of SARS-CoV infection is essential to the management of the disease."
449,75893,"Cardiovascular complications of influenza infection, including myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and exacerbation of heart failure have been well-recognized during previous historical epidemics and make a significant contribution to mortality. 4 Likewise, previous coronavirus outbreaks have been associated with a significant burden of cardiovascular comorbidities and complications ( Table 1) . Furthermore, the severity of the primary respiratory syndrome and risk of adverse outcomes is increased in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. 11 Hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, arrhythmia, or even sudden cardiac death are common in patients with SARS. Electrocardiographic changes and troponin elevation may signal underlying myocarditis, and echocardiography frequently demonstrates sub-clinical left ventricular diastolic impairment (with a higher likelihood of the need for mechanical ventilation in those with systolic impairment and reduced ejection fraction). 7, 12 The opinions expressed in this article are not necessarily those of the Editors of the European Heart Journal or of the European Society of Cardiology. Early COVID-19 case reports suggest that patients with underlying conditions are at higher risk for complications or mortality-up to 50% of hospitalized patients have a chronic medical illness (40% cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease). In the largest published clinical cohort of COVID-19 to date, acute cardiac injury, shock, and arrhythmia were present in 7.2%, 8.7%, and 16.7% of patients, respectively, 10 with higher prevalence amongst patients requiring intensive care."
450,367383,"The rapid spread of the virus SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the related pneumonia COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) are a major challenge for healthcare systems worldwide. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 increases with age. While it is 0% for children younger than 10 years, it increases up to 1% in the sixth decade of life and exceeds 20% in the ninth decade (Onder et al., 2020) . However, it was obvious already at a very early stage of the pandemic that healthcare workers are affected in 29% of the cases, which is disproportionately high (Wang et al., 2020) . Inevitably, healthcare workers are in close contact with infected patients. Transmission of the virus seems to occur mainly by respiratory droplets (Lu et al., 2020; van Doremalen et al., 2020) . There is a high viral load in the nasal cavity of infected patients, which especially puts those specialties at risk for a SARS-CoV-2 infection that are located around this region (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Besides ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons and dentists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons especially have to be aware of the new challenges that the risk of virus transmission between patients and medical staff, and vice versa, imply (Peng et al., 2020) . During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the specialty must organize patient treatment in such a way that infection transmission is reduced to a minimum, while all relevant treatment options are at hand to provide adequate patient care. Also, there must be preparation for situations in which a shortage of disposability of medical staff might occur or anesthesiologic capacity might be reduced for oral and maxillofacial surgery patients due to a focus on critically ill COVID-19 patients. Concepts have to be developed that take into account the possible need for triaging patients according to the degree of urgency of treatment in the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery. Currently, specific guidelines and recommendations are just evolving. It is not surprising that at this stage, with limited clinical evidence, even conflicting points of view concerning the most adequate handling of some scenarios have to be discussed. Therefore, the aim of the present narrative-style review is to collect and to discuss aspects of approaching the management of inpatients and outpatients in oral and maxillofacial surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The languages of literature included English and Chinese. The point prevalence of severe COVID-19 in patients with pre-existing COPD and those with ongoing smoking was evaluated with this meta-analysis. Overall 11 case series, published either in Chinese or English language with a total of 2002 cases, were included in this study. The pooled OR of COPD and the development of severe COVID-19 was 4.38 (fixed-effects model; 95% CI: 2.34-8.20), while the OR of ongoing smoking was 1.98 (fixed-effects model; 95% CI: 1.29-3.05).

452,1906572,"We estimated the transmission rate within Wuhan, , to be 1.94 d -1 (95%CI, 1.25-6.71), while we found the infectious period to be 1.61 days (95%CI, 0.35-3.23). We calculated the basic reproductive number, 0 , of the infection to be 3.11 (95%CI, 2.39-4.13), comparable to the range for SARS estimated from outbreaks during the 2003 epidemic (Lipsitch et al., 2003; World Health Organization, 2003) . We highlight that this number is highly uncertain and that a large range of parameters are consistent with the data given the assumptions of our model. This estimate reflects both the dynamics of transmission and, potentially, the dynamics of case reporting, with increases as reporting over time potentially increasing our estimate. The estimate we give here represents an update from the report of 23 January in which we estimated a higher 0 , and highlights the sensitivity of our findings to additional data at this early period. The current estimate of 0 is significantly greater than 1, the epidemic threshold, providing evidence that sustained human-to-human transmission is occurring in China. Further, it suggests that a concerted effort will be required to control the outbreak, requiring between 38% and 80% of transmission to be averted to control the epidemic."
453,2035383,"RV-A was the predominant species in both study populations, followed closely by RV-C. RV-B was observed only sporadically. These findings are in accordance with other studies [9, 16, 17] in both non-hospitalised and hospitalised children and suggest that our populations are representative for larger populations. The distribution of the RV species was comparable in nonhospitalised and hospitalised children. Also in children with respiratory distress who required ICU-admission the distribution of RV species did not differ significantly from the non-hospitalised children. RV-C was not overrepresented in hospitalised children nor in ICU-admitted children suggesting that in our study populations an infection with RV-C alone might not be associated with more severe disease. Previous studies on disease severity showed that infection with RV-C was associated with more severe respiratory symptoms in children. However, these studies were mainly conducted in hospitalised patients where specific risk groups, such as immunocompromised patients, were overrepresented which might bias the results [5, 18] . More recent studies are consistent with our findings [3, 19, 20] . In addition, several studies in adults were in line with our results [21, 22] ."
454,1867942,"The predominant viruses reported in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) comprised adenovirus, rhinoviruses, influenza A and B, and coxsackie/echovirus between 2009 and 2012 [21] . Adenovirus-associated respiratory disease, outbreaks and death have been reported in several countries amongst military recruits [10, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 27, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . Males and close contact with a person with respiratory symptoms within 10 days before their own onset of illness were associated with adenovirus infection, but sleeping adjacent to someone ill with respiratory symptoms did not present higher risk to infection [39] . Influenza A and B viruses have also resulted in much morbidity in outbreaks, particularly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection [11, 12, 17, 20, 21, 26, 44] . Some of the risk factors proposed were crowded living quarters defined as more than three personnel and age group less than 40 year old [45] , asthma and obesity [46] , age group less than 30 years old and the high proportion of military who had being seroconverted [47] . Human rhinoviruses are known to cause common cold as well as more complicated respiratory infections [9, [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] . All known human rhinoviruses have been reported to be present in military recruits during respiratory infection [53] . Association of rhinovirus with lower respiratory tract infections is well documented [54] . Viral interference has also been proposed between rhinovirus and adenovirus infection [38] . Stress factor due to adaptation to new and different surroundings for military recruits was also proposed as risk factor for rhinovirus infection [48] . In this study, we investigate the risk factors associated with FRI and the predominant viral aetiologies of FRI in a semi-closed military environment of the SAF."

458,1315495,"Antiviral medications such as oseltamivir and zanamivir have been shown to reduce the severity and duration of seasonal influenza. However, their efficacy in treating a potential influenza pandemic is uncertain. Therefore, a vaccine against circulating strains of the H5N1 virus will be critical in preventing widespread transmission of the virus should it develop the ability to spread readily among humans. In this regard, techniques to rapidly isolate and sequence circulating influenza viruses have been developed. Using a technique known as reverse genetics, researchers in academia and industry have developed prototype vaccines against the H5N1 virus and are currently testing their safety and immunogenicity in human volunteers. In a recent clinical trial, 451 healthy adult volunteers were vaccinated with two intramuscular doses of an inactivated H5N1 vaccine produced by Sanofi-Pasteur. Preliminary data indicate that the vaccine was well-tolerated and induced an antibody response predictive of protection, albeit at high doses (unpublished data). A trial of the same vaccine among >260 elderly volunteers is underway, with a third trial in pediatric volunteers planned for the spring of 2006."
459,2034324,"Position 3606 belongs to Nsp6, a protein that induces the formation of autophagosomes, which is a sign of starvation in uninfected cells (Cottam, Whelband, and Wileman 2014) . Autophagosomes can act as an innate defense against viral infection but they can be hijacked and support the assembly of coronavirus replicase proteins (Orvedahl et al. 2007; Suhy, Giddings, and Kirkegaard 2000; Wileman 2006 ). Together with Nsp3 and Nsp4, Nsp6 moreover promotes the formation of the double membrane vesicles typically observed in SARS disease (Angelini et al. 2013 ). Nsp6 is a protein with 7 transmembrane domains (Oostra et al. 2008 ) and position 3606 lays in the luminal loop between the first and second hydrophobic transmembrane domains. In the wild type SARS-CoV-2 sequence, we find 3 Phenylalanine residues just before L3606. Instead, some of the variants in this paper have a stretch of 4 Phenylalanine, keeping this region highly hydrophobic."
460,1980430,"The aetiology of diarrhoeal syndrome is quite complex involving many infectious agents of bacterial, viral and protozoan nature. Among the bacterial and viral agents Escherichia coli and rotavirus are notable one. In general E. coli plays predominant role during first week and rotavirus is more important between 7 and 30 days of age (Lucchelli et al., 1992) However, the precise role of each pathogen in different geographical conditions is not known. Rotavirus was first discovered to be an animal pathogen in 1969 by Mebus et al. (1969) . Since then it has been accepted as an important aetiological agent of diarrhoea in neonates of almost all animal species, humans and even in birds. These viruses are subdivided into seven antigenically distinct groups designated A through G (Estes, 2001) . Most of rotaviruses detected in clinical specimens of domestic animals belong to group A (Theil et al., 1995) . Ovine rotaviruses, in contrast to the globally distributed rotaviruses infecting other livestock, have been reported from few countries like UK, Japan, Morocco, Australia, USA (Chasey and Banks, 1984; Makabe et al., 1985; Fassi-Fehri et al., 1988; Ellis and Daniels, 1988; Theil et al., 1995) . Both groups A and B rotaviruses infect lambs (Snodgrass et al., 1976) but group B rotaviruses have been shown to be more common cause of rotavirus diarrhoea in neonatal lambs (Chasey and Banks, 1984; Snodgrass et al., 1984) . In India, the work on ovine rotavirus infection was initiated in 2000 only (Anon, 2001) . Wani et al. (in press) are first to report the presence of rotavirus in diarrhoeic lambs in India."

466,1943527,"Epidemics of Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever result in a fatal illness in the majority of patients who become infected, with case-fatality rates nearing 90%. Studies of patients who survive infection indicate that components of the adaptive immune system are activated in infected survivors [1] , suggesting that vaccination of target populations could significantly reduce mortality from exposure to Ebola virus. We previously described a vaccine that elicits strong adaptive immune responses and uniformly protects nonhuman primates from a high-dose challenge with Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) [2, 3] . A single immunization with vectors derived from adenovirus type 5 (5 Ad5) containing Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) genes elicited protective immune responses within 1 mo. The strength of rAd5 vectors for use as vaccines derives from their ability to elicit rapid immunity due to high insert expression levels and natural targeting of Ad5 to dendritic cells, which may enhance antigen presentation. Moreover, the use of replicationdefective viral vectors for gene delivery is desirable from a safety perspective for products that will be developed for human use."
467,410024,"Chest CT vs. RT-PCR viral nucleic acid testing. The real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for COVID-19 is believed to have high specificity but sensitivity has been reported to be as low as 60%-70% (8, 9) . Thus, excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19 requires multiple negative tests, with test kits in short supply or unavailable in some regions of China. In response to reports of lung abnormalities on CT predating conversion to positive RT-PCR, Chinese authorities initially broadened the official definition of infection to include patients with typical findings at CT, even with a first negative RT-PCR result. This broader definition has resulted in a higher number of presumptive cases of COVID-19 and an increasing role for CT in diagnosis. However, the presence of mild or no CT findings in many early cases of infection highlights the difficulties of early detection (6, 10) ."
468,2339308,"The evidence that suggests that the etiology of KD can be traced to an infectious agent includes temporal clustering and marked seasonality, geographic clustering, a strong association between the frequency of KD and infectious-disease surveillance [2, 9] , and age distribution (with the highest incidence among children 6 months to 2 years old, who have little maternal antibody and are, in general, the most susceptible to infection) [2] . Various infectious agents have been implicated as potential causes of KD, as have certain immunological agents and toxins, including bacterial toxin-mediated superantigens, allergens such as anionic detergents and house dust mites, and some chemicals. To date, no link between any of these individual agents and KD has been irrefutably established. Recently, infection with a novel human coronavirus (HCoV), called ""New Haven coronavirus"" (HCoV-NH) [10] -which is similar to and likely represents the same species as another novel HCoV, HCoV-NL63 [11] -was reported to be associated with KD [12] . Shortly thereafter, 2 groups of researchers reported that they did not find any association between HCoV-NH infection and KD [13, 14] . Therefore, controversy exists as to whether there is an association between HCoV-NH infection and KD, and further studies are needed to investigate whether the virus plays a role in the etiology of KD. Thus, we evaluated whether HCoV-NH infection is associated with KD in Taiwan."

470,1762801,"The study reported here was done on the basis of inoculation of 3 male animals with a human isolate of MERS-CoV, and the study design we used imposed several limitations on how these data inform what occurs in natural infections. The camels we inoculated were exposed to a high dose of virus by 3 simultaneous routes of inoculation. In retrospect, the inoculation dose does not seem excessive, based on the large quantity of virus shed nasally in all 3 animals ( Figure 2 ). The total dose inoculated was relatively equivalent to the amount of virus present in a single nasal swab sample taken during the first days postinoculation, and it seems probable that a camel shedding this quantity of virus would readily infect other camels or humans with which it had direct contact. The fact that we inoculated the camels with the virus by 3 routes precludes drawing conclusions regarding efficiency of transmission by a particular route, which is a topic that should be addressed in future studies. The influence of camel age on susceptibility and dynamics of virus shedding is another notable parameter that requires further study. It seems likely that productive infection and shedding of virus in natural settings occurs predominantly in juvenile camels (28) . This could be the result of an intrinsic difference in age-related susceptibility, but is more likely related to the immunologically naïve status of the animals in the context of a high force of infection after decay of passively acquired antibodies. The animals we infected were young adults, but were seronegative and therefore probably as susceptible as juveniles from MERS-CoV-endemic regions. Another aspect of pathogenesis not addressed here is whether virus is present in milk or meat from infected camels and thereby poses another potential route of exposure to humans who consume such products. Despite these limitations, the magnitude and pattern of virus shedding was essentially identical in all 3 animals and supports the available epidemiologic data indicating that camels are likely a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV. Additional experimental and field studies are clearly required to address the duration of shedding of infectious MERS-CoV from infected camels, to determine whether infection results in protective immunity, and to clarify the burden of illness among humans resulting from transmission from camels.

471,3117967,"The history of informed consent is one of continuous evolution in search of a best practice, from the mid-20 th century, physician-oriented -paternalistic‖ approach to the -reasonable patient‖ standard established by Canterbury v Spence in 1972 [1]. The process of surgical informed consent still eludes a single, universal template. It is an inherently idiosyncratic interaction during which the experience, clinical judgment, and biases of the surgeon are distilled into a focused conversation between caregiver and patient, with the goal of reaching agreement and, ultimately, permission to proceed with a recommended intervention. Ideally, the surgeon weaves data and evidence (-facts and figures‖) extracted from textbooks, published scientific literature, and other sources into a narrative tailored to fit the needs of the patient including the perceived appetite of that patient for information [2] ."
472,689859,"Analysis of positive selection of MERS-CoV spike genes indicated that several adaptive variants arose in MERS-CoV and in phylogenetically related CoVs [42] . Contrary to common expectation and to what happened during the SARS-CoV host shift to humans, positive selection did not target the RBD. In fact, most adaptive substitutions were detected in the region encompassing the heptad repeats, regions of central importance for virus cell entry ( Figure 3A ) [42, 43] . In other CoVs, variants in the heptad repeats were previously shown to affect host or tissue tropism [44] [45] [46] . Interestingly, during the South Korean outbreak, MERS-CoVs that carry point mutations in the spike protein RBD emerged and rapidly spread [47] . These viruses showed decreased binding to the cellular receptor [47] ( Figure 3A ). Because several immune epitopes are located in the RBD, these findings point to the possibility that MERS-CoV is evolving to avoid the binding of neutralizing antibodies, resulting in a trade-off with receptor-binding affinity [47] . If this were the case, the phases of MERS-CoV adaptation to humans may have consisted of initial events that modulated host tropism through changes in the heptad repeats followed by the emergence of virus variants that escape immune responses. In MERS-CoV and other lineage C beta-CoVs, positive selection also targeted the nonstructural components, particularly ORF1a [48] . Most adaptive events occurred in nsp3, a multifunctional protein which acts as a viral protease and contributes to the suppression of interferon responses through its deubiquitinating and deI-SGylating activities [49] . Selection in nsp3 is ongoing among MERS-CoV isolated from humans and camels [48] . In analogy to the S protein, though, no major selective event was found to be associated with camel-to-human transmission, although a positively selected change (R911C) in nsp3 was observed among human-derived viruses alone, suggesting that viral adaptation to our species represented the underlying pressure [48] ."
473,1618617,"Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection began in 2019, the disease has rapidly spread worldwide [1] . SARS-CoV-2 infection causes dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, which may lead to death [2] . As on April 26, 2020, 2,774,135 SARS-CoV-2-infected cases and 190,871 related deaths have been confirmed worldwide (https://who.sprinklr.com/). SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission efficiency, with the reproduction number (R0) estimated to be 2.5 [3] . Many experts predict that SARS-CoV-2 may persist for a long time and will cause at least 500,000 deaths worldwide [4] . The World Health Organization has announced the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) as an international public health emergency [5] . Therefore, developing safe and effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs is urgently needed. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which comprises the largest positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses [6] . These viruses are classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ). SARS-CoV, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 are β-coronaviruses [7] . Analysis of the genome sequences of these three viruses has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher identity to SARS-CoV (89.1% nucleotide similarity) than to MERS-CoV [8] . The 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) is a cysteine protease that hydrolyzes the polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab to produce functional proteins during coronavirus replication. Because of its highly conserved sequence and essential functional properties, 3CL pro has been validated as a potential target for the development of drugs to treat SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 [9] [10] [11] [12] . At present, a variety of natural and synthetic inhibitors that target different sites and regions of 3CL pro have been developed [13] [14] [15] . As the highly conserved catalytic sites of 3CL pro are shared by the three coronaviruses [12, 16] , tremendous efforts have been made to study this target to speed up the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs among previously approved drugs, clinical trial candidates, and bioactive agents that were identified in preclinical studies as potential treatments for SARS and MERS [17] . These studies may provide more potential active compounds or drug candidates for the development of new drugs against COVID-19 [18] ."

All virus-inoculated pigs seroconverted and produced neutralizing antibodies to TGEV, and both the TGEV and PRCV groups had similar antibody titers at PID 24 before challenge. After TGEV challenge, serum antibody titers increased nearly lOO-fold in the PRCV group compared with less than a two-fold increase in the TGEV group. The control pigs challenged with TGEV seroconverted by PCD 8."
476,1565193,"Besides for S protein incorporation into the viral envelope the membrane-proximal region of the spike protein is also of critical significance for the membrane fusion function of the protein. Though clearly distinct processes, the truncations in the spike CD affected both features similarly, a short truncation having limited effect, longer truncations interfering increasingly both with assembly and with fusion. The importance of the cysteine-rich region for membrane fusion has already been established before (Bos et al., 1995; Chang et al., 2000) . It was shown that a spike mutant from which part of the cysteine-rich region had been deleted, was able to promote hemifusion, but blocked in fusion pore formation. In addition, single cysteine mutations severely impaired membrane fusion activity (Chang et al., 2000) . Whether this effect was due to acylation being prevented is unclear but it is conceivable that the membrane-inserted hydrophobic acyl chains play a role in fusion pore formation. A positive role of palmitoylation in cell fusion has been reported for influenza virus HA protein (Naeve and Williams, 1990; Sakai et al., 2002) , but this role was found to be negative for VSV (Whitt and Rose, 1991) , influenza virus (Naim et al., 1992; Steinhauer et al., 1991) , or the Murine leukemia virus fusion protein (Yang and Compans, 1996) ."
477,1009666,"Airborne IAV densities were highest in the school corridor, which was expected, and can be partially explained by two factors. First, student lockers are situated along the walls of the corridor which encourages air turbulence as students pass through the corridor and open and shut locker doors. Second, the corridor represents the only available passage between classrooms and therefore each student passes through the corridor multiple times per day, which dually increases the probability that an infectious student will shed virus in the area, and that other students will be exposed. In a college student office setting, Zhang and Li (2018) 41 demonstrated that the frequency of close contact (within 1 m) is 9.64 contacts per hour per student, which contributed to 45% of reported IAV infections. Additionally, previous studies have suggested that influenza illness and death rates could be decreased by as much as 50% by reducing the contact rates of infected persons 42 . Given the high airborne IAV densities detected in the school corridor, along with elevated student contact rates, it is plausible to conclude that the school corridor is a ""hotspot"" for influenza virus transmission."
478,2877389,"The interpretation of the findings in our four dogs with chronic lesions (56-63 days p.i.) is difficult in respect to recovery and remyelination. Two of these dogs had no clinical signs, the other two had clinically improved after an initial period of severe neurologic impairment. However, as shown on previous occasions (Summers et al. 1979; Vandevelde et al. 1982b; Higgins et al. 1982) clinico-pathologic correlations are often lacking in distemper. We cannot exclude that these four dogs had only mild lesions in the acute stage of infection. Thus, our immunohistological findings showing only minor myelin changes in these dogs cannot be taken as evidence of remyelination which is known to occur in distemper (McCullough et al. 1974; Higgins et al. 1982) , without corresponding ultrastructural studies of the same lesions."
479,1969108,"Monitoring of viral evolution in similarly relevant time scales for other quickly evolving pathogens, such as coronaviruses, lags further behind and is an area of research with much needed additional attention. For example, recent evolutionary analyses of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus have helped to elucidate viral transmission dynamics between camels and people (Dudas et al. 2018) . We also now know that viruses sharing diverse vertebrate hosts are ''worth watching'' for potential emergence in humans, because host breadth (i.e., infecting a taxonomically diverse range of hosts) is a key factor associated with a virus' likelihood of spillover and secondary human-to-human transmission and geographic spread (Johnson et al. 2015; Olival et al. 2017 ). Thus, expanding ''real-time'' surveillance of such pathogens would be a worthwhile investment for public health."
480,1984611,"Interferon-induced helicase C domain-containing protein 1 (IFIH1) is a gene encoding Melanoma Differentiation Association Protein 5 (MDA5), a RIG-I-like cytoplasmic sensor of long double-stranded RNA, which is key in innate immune recognition of RNA viruses.

Autosomal dominant gain-of-function variants in IFIH1 are known to cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (3) . Other variants have been found to predispose to autoimmune conditions like type-1 diabetes, vitiligo, autoimmune thyroiditis, and SLE (4) .

481,1615610,"The binding of coronavirus to its specific receptor on the target cell is an initial step of infection [7] [8] [9] . Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [10] [11] [12] . The S protein of SARS-CoV can bind to ACE2 with high affinity and mediates viral entry. A 193residue fragment within S1 domain (residues 318-510) has been defined as a minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Fig. 1) [4, 13, 14] . Crystal structure of an independently folded RBD bound to human ACE2 reveals that residues 424-494 constitute the receptor-binding motif (RBM) [15] . The S2 domain of SARS-CoV S protein contains a putative fusion peptide and two heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2), which can associate to form a six helix bundle comprised of three helices from HR1 that run antiparallel to three helices from HR2 [16] [17] [18] ."
482,2866064,"In the immediate aftermath of the SARS epidemic, psychiatric morbidity of individual patients began to emerge. The main problems involved adjustment reactions with increased anxiety levels [4] [5] [6] [7] . Studies showed that 10-35% of SARS survivors reported having features of anxiety, depression or both during the early recovery phase [3, 8, 9] . Other studies examined the features of post-traumatic stress reactions in SARS survivors in the early postdischarge period [3, 10] . A series of studies using the Chinese version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) revealed that 45% of the respondents had at least one active diagnosable psychiatric disorder at 2 to 4 weeks after discharge [11] . Persistent psychopathologies such as major depression (23.6%), adjustment disorder (8.1%) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (7.3%) were also noted at 6 months postdischarge [12] . However, the reliability, validity and generalisation of the above studies are limited by low response rates of 28% to 65% [3, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , the sole reliance on self-administered instruments [3, 5, 6, [8] [9] [10] and the use of convenience sampling methods."
483,1981494,"Infectious diseases are considered to be ""emerging"" if they appear in a new population or geographic region or are occurring with greater frequency than the expected background rate [1] [2] [3] . Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are capable of causing debilitating health effects and financial instability, especially in less developed countries with insufficient capacity to mount health interventions, and thus pose a significant global public health challenge in the 21 st [4] . An estimated 60-75% of EIDs are comprised of zoonotic diseases; of these, more than 70% have purportedly originated in wildlife species [3] [4] [5] . Spillover has been largely attributed to changes in anthropogenic activity subsequent to exponential human population growth since the latter half of the 20 th century. Large-scale land use change, such as deforestation and land conversion for agriculture, can alter host-pathogen relationships and increase human encounter rates with wildlife and their pathogens, making cross-species transmission events more likely [6, 7] . For established pathogens, human-mediated biodiversity loss often leads to reduced populations of suboptimal host species and increased numbers of competent or amplifying hosts, potentially precipitating higher infection rates in people [8] . In addition, intensification of livestock and poultry production systems results in artificially dense populations of domestic animals, which can lead to pathogen amplification and spillover to humans [7] . Approximately two-thirds of human pathogens occupy complex, multi-host systems, and pathogens with multiple animal hosts, including some wildlife species, are more likely to become emergent [9] ."
484,1119044,"The rapid spread and high economic cost of COVID-19 have exposed the shortcomings of the healthcare system writ large and have highlighted the urgency of rethinking how services are delivered in the USA. Social distancing measures paired with the realization of politicians, policymakers, and citizens of the importance of telehealth in the context of the pandemic are likely to lead to a significant shift in attitudes and behavior and result in a larger-scale adoption of telehealth in the long term. While we welcome the temporary changes made to improve access to care and address the psychological side effects of quarantine and isolation, we believe that some of these changes should be made permanent. Moving forward, the integration of telehealth, particularly telemental health, should not be seen as a temporary fix in times of emergency; rather, it is a safe, effective, convenient, scalable, and sustainable method of healthcare delivery that is as crucial as it is inevitable."
485,1628405,"The reduction of the viral load at 5 dpi in the group infected with the rIBYZ strain may be associated with the necrosis and shedding of the trachea epithelium. Moreover, the ability to replication in the different organs of chickens infected with rH120-S1/YZ as reflected by viral loads at multiple time points was lower than that exhibited in the chickens infected with the rIBYZ strain, which demonstrated that the S1 subunit was not the only determinant of viral tropism that was consistent with results by others [57, 61, 62] , and the significant difference in viral load was related to differences in the viral backbone. However, when comparing the rH120-S1/YZ and rH120 strains which carry the same backbone, it was found that the viral RNA of rH120-S1/YZ in the lungs and kidneys was significantly lower than that of rH120, which may due to the replacement of the IBYZ S1 gene in the recombinant virus, whose structure on the surface contains some degree of changes, which we speculated that may affects the functionality of the S protein of coronaviruses. Although cryo-EM structure of IBV spike protein has been determined, the relation between structure and function of different IBV S1 genes is unknown. [63] . In addition to the growth in epithelial tissues observed during the early infection period, IBV can establish long-term persistent infections in chicken flocks via oral and cloacal shedding, which represents a substantial challenge to IBV control [1, 6] . In this study, we detected viral RNA in the oral and cloacal swabs isolated from infected chickens at 7, 14, 18, 22, and 26 dpi by real-time PCR. Compared with rH120 and rIBYZ, the viral load in both the oral and cloacal swabs of the rH120-S1/YZ group at different time points after infection was significantly decreased. However, while it has been reported that the persistent virus will be re-excreted at the point of lay [1] , the persistence of rH120-S1/YZ strain in the egg-laying chickens needs to be further verified. In a word, due to its low virulence i presented in virus loading and lesion in different tissue, oral and cloacal shedding of host animals, rH120-S1/YZ can be considered a safe attenuated vaccine candidate for young chickens."
486,147457,"The neurotoxins produced by C. botulinum are among the most potent poisons known and there is a need to prepare for their use in a bioterrorism attack. 1,2 Naturally, human botulism mainly involves BoNT types A, B, E and F, 4 and serotypes C and D mostly affect domestic animals. Given the ease of preparation and potential toxicity of all these neurotoxins, it is equally important to develop vaccines against all these toxins for biodefense. In this study, we evaluated the vaccination strategy against the BoNT/C and expect ultimately to apply the same platform to develop vaccines against all serotypes of BoNTs. Here, we have described a novel adenoviral vector delivery of a botulism vaccine against type C neurotoxin that when delivered as a single i.n. dose proved to be a highly effective vaccine. Owing to the single i.n. route of vaccination, this vaccine could be selfadministered to protect the population in the event of terrorist attack with C. botulism or neurotoxins. In addition to the ease of administration and rapid onset of protection described here, the vaccine could be produced inexpensively, in high quantity and in a short time frame. We chose H C 50 fragment of BoNT type C because the H C 50 subunits of BoNTs are non-toxic and antigenic, and are capable of eliciting immunity responses against botulism. 8,10-12 Also in a previous study we showed that i.m. vaccination with Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 elicited strong systemic immunity that lasted at least 27 weeks and mice receiving the vaccine were fully protected against BoNT/C challenge. 31 BoNTs can be lethal by ingestion of minute amounts in food and/or by inhalation. The latter delivery mode is the strongest bioterrorism-related threat. 32, 33 The mucosal immune system is the first line of defense against botulism. However, the current injection-type botulism toxoid vaccine only provides protective immunity in the systemic compartment. Clearly, the development of a safe and effective mucosal vaccine should be a high priority against bioterrorism-related botulism. 34 Previous research by Kobayashi et al. 35 showed that nasal vaccination with BoNT/A toxoid plus a mutant of cholera toxin (E112K) effectively prevents mucosal BoNT intoxication in mice. Maddaloni et al. 36 recently showed that mucosal vaccination with adenovirus type 2 fiber fused with H C 50 of BoNT/A elicited robust mucosal antibody response, and addition of cholera toxin (CT) as an adjuvunt in the vaccine further enhanced protective immunity in mice against challenge with active BoNT/A. These studies proved the feasibility for developing a nasal vaccine against botulism. Adenoviruses invade their host naturally through the mucosa surface, notably in the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. 37 Adenoviral vector vaccines can be effectively delivered by i.n. mucosal route and can induce strong adaptive immune responses in mammalian hosts. 21, 22 The replicationincompetent adenoviral vector Ad/opt-BoNT/C-H C 50 studied here given as a protective, single i.n. vaccination elicited not only high serum antibody response to BoNTC/H C 50 but also high specific antibody response in mucosal secretions."
487,1212393,"The 64-residue LFP demonstrated bipartite helical and extended conformations. The N-terminus of LFP assumes an amphipathic helical structure, residues R4-Q12, followed by residues M13-L19 adopted loop like conformations (Fig. 5) . Residues K20-I30 delineated two short stretches of helix connected by a loop, whereby the aromatic ring of residues F22 and F27 are in close packing interactions (Fig. 6) . It is noteworthy that residues M13-L31, in isolation, largely formed a compact helical structure with bends observed at residues G23-G24 [56] . However, these residues M13-L31 in LFP assumed rather discontinuous helical and extended conformations (Fig. 5) . These observations potentially indicate that the adjoining sequences of fusion proteins might influence conformations of FPs. Note, influenza hemagglutinin FPs showed large structural differences depending on the length of the amino acid sequences [24, 25] . A recent study, using solid state NMR in lipid bilayer, has deduced close and semi-closed structural states of the hemagglutinin FP [72] . The determination of an amphipathic helical structure at the N-terminus of FP, in DPC micelle, may be considered as a novel feature of the SARS-CoV fusion protein. The Nterminal helical segment of LFP in DPC micelle demonstrated motional rigidity (Fig. 8 ) and found to be inserted into the micelle core (Fig. 9) . It is likely that the N-terminal helix of the fusion protein of SARS-CoV may be important for membrane fusion activity. The C-terminal half of LFP is defined by a 20-residue long helix, residues F42-Y62, that essentially encompasses the entire distal FP, except Ser42 (or Ser798), (Figs. 1 and 5 ). The C-terminal helix can be further extended to include residues K39-R40 with a hinge at S42 (Fig. 5) . The Pro rich sequence appeared to adopt extended conformations (Fig. 5) . As seen, the C-terminus helix of LFP contains a large nonpolar surface with shallow patches of polar regions (Fig. 7) . The nonpolar surface of the C-terminal helix including the residues located in the adjacent loop of LFP could be deeply inserted into the hydrophobic core of micelle (Fig. 9 ). Further, 15 N-{ 1 H} heteronuclear NOE data demonstrated that many residues belonging to the C-terminus helix is motionally rigid in DPC micelle (Fig. 8 ). Functional assays, by Ala scanning mutagenesis, demonstrated that the hydrophobic residues of the C-terminal helix of S2 fusion protein are critical for cell-cell fusion [55] . Recent studies have determined prefusion structures of S proteins of coronaviruses that are homologous to SARS-CoV [73, 74] . Interestingly, the C-terminal LFP region has been found to be adopting helical conformations that was buried inside the prefusion protein complex [73, 74] . As noted, S proteins of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV differ from influenza virus and HIV-1 [74] . In particular, the S protein of SARS-CoV contains a larger segment upstream of HR1. In the prefusion state, this polypeptide segment has been found to be buried and adopted helical conformations [74] . Peptide derived from this intervening region showed membrane interactions and fusion [48] [49] [50] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Therefore, it has postulated that membrane fusion process mediated by coronaviruses and SARS-CoV could be different from other type I viral fusion proteins [29, 38, 50, 51, 54, 74] . FPs may experience conformational variations depending on lipid or detergent micelle environments [24, 25, 72, 75] . The potential influence of the curved DPC micelles on the 3-D structure and dynamics of LFP cannot be ascertained at this point. Notably, determination of atomic resolution structure of large fusion protein like LFP embedded in lipid bilayer could be highly challenging. Regardless, atomic resolution structure of LFP of SARS-CoV, in complex of zwitterionic DPC micelle, and its localization within micelle core obtained in this study can perhaps aid in better understating of membrane fusion mechanism. The S protein mediated membrane fusion requires helical coiled-coil complex of HR1 and HR2 and multiple FPs leading to the formation of fusion pore [54, 56] . The extended helical structures of LFP along with the FPs, at the N-and C-termini, may be inserted into membrane aligning with HR1 and HR2 helices that may essentially enhance the process of membrane mixing and pore formation. In addition, FPs of SARS-CoV were found to inhibit viral infection perhaps due to their interactions with cell membranes [76, 77] . Therefore, we surmise that atomic-resolution structure of LFP and membrane fusion mechanism may be further utilized for the development of drugs against SARS."
488,2037945,"called the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) (Jung & Saif, 2015) . PEDV reference strain, CV777, was isolated in Belgium in 1977 (Pensaert & de Bouk, 1978) . After several outbreaks in the 70s, PED has been persisting in Europe with sporadic cases until the late 1990s (Jung & Saif, 2015) . Outbreaks of PED were also described in Asia in the 1980s and then between 2010 and 2012 (Jung & Saif, 2015; Wang et al., 2013) . A new type of strain, genetically different from the reference strain, was isolated during those recent outbreaks, inducing a strong mortality despite the frequent uses of vaccines based on CV777 strain in Asia (Li et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013) . In 2013, swine producers in the United States of America were hit by PED although the country had previously been free from the disease. The PED disease spread rapidly throughout the country and in neighbouring countries of North and South America such as Canada and Mexico. Two genetically distant PEDV strains were isolated in the USA, namely the non-InDel strains, genetically similar to the aforementioned Asian strains, and the InDel strains, showing insertions-deletions in the S1 part of the S gene (Jung & Saif, 2015; Vlasova et al., 2014) . From clinical reports, these two strains seemed to behave differently in terms of morbidity and mortality: The non-InDel strains were associated with more severe clinical cases and higher case fatality rate compared with the InDel strains (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014 ). In contrast with non-InDel strains, exclusively reported in America and Asia, InDel strains were also identified in Europe since 2014 (EFSA, 2016; Stadler et al., 2015 , Vlasova et al., 2014 . To date, PEDV circulates in America, Asia and Europe with different patterns in terms of epidemiological behaviour and persistence of the virus in the pig population."
489,1212222,"The studies conducted on newly emerged novel 2019 coronavirus reported that COVID-19 have more than 79.5% identical sequence to bat-coronavirus. Moreover, the polyprotein namely PP1AB has more than 86% identical sequence as SARS-CoV (Chan et al. 2020; Chen, Yiu, et al. 2020) . reported that 20 different predicted sites for N-glycosylation are present in coronavirus. The spike (S) proteins in coronavirus formed the trimers and are located on the surface of the virus and serve as entry proteins for the infection. The trimers developed by spike proteins are broken via different cellular proteases to enable the fusion between infected cells and virus membranes (Bian et al. 2009 ). The cellular proteases develop two types of subunits, including S1 and S2 on the spike molecule of coronavirus. Among them, the S1 subunit bears the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which bind with ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) (see Glossary) of host cells. Besides, the receptor-binding motifs (RBM), coronavirus contain trypsin abundantly on the surface of RBD which facilitate the direct bonding with ACE-2 of host cells (Kirchdoerfer et al. 2016; Walls et al. 2016 ). ACE-2 is known as type 1 integral protein (805 amino acids) which carry one zinc-binding consequence sequence as HEXXH-E (G€ uler et al. 2020) . ACE-2 is a chief cell receptor for the binding of coronavirus to target cells (caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome), which is expressed in the lower respiratory tract of humans and regulate transmissions either from human-to-human or cross-species . The recent evidence showed that the expression of ACE-2 (released by epithelial cells of the lung) for COVID-19 increases with diseases like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Therefore, the susceptibility of COVID-19 for ACE-2 become increase in already infected persons. Hence, the binding of COVID-19 with ACE-2 receptor of the host cell is substantial a determining factor for the pathogenesis of the infection (Fang et al. 2020) ."
490,1854625,"The rapid emergence and spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has presented disruptive challenges to the healthcare system in the United States (US). In response, there have been systems-based changes within US cardiac surgical programs in efforts to enhance containment measures and to preserve essential resources needed to treat an influx of COVID-19 patients. The World Health Organization identified COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020 and within days, many cardiac surgical programs made drastic changes to their clinical practices with reductions in surgical volume due to delayed elective cases, reassignment of providers to intensive care settings outside their usual scope of practice, and the integration of virtual clinics for patient evaluation (1) . As these systems-based changes were evolving, guidelines with adequate specificity to address the complexity of decision-making for delaying cardiac surgery were unavailable. As a result, many hospital systems in combination with their heart teams developed program-specific policies. We surveyed US cardiac surgeons to gain insights into the variability of programmatic responses to COVID-19."
491,2915592,"Three of the most abundant and well-understood proteins in the nucleolus are nucleolin, fibrillarin and B23. Nucleolin (first called C23), represents approximately 10% of the total nucleolar protein content and is highly phosphorylated, methylated, and also can be ADP-ribosylated [25] . Nucleolin has the potential to bind to multiple RNA targets and this may reflect its variety of functions [25, 26] . One of the main functions of nucleolin is facilitating the first cleavage step of rRNA in the presence of U3 snoRNP. Nucleolin may function as a chaperone for correct folding in pre-rRNA processing [27] . Nucleolin has also been implicated as a repressor of transcription [78] . Whilst mammalian nucleolin has a predicted molecular mass of approximately 77 kDa (depending on the species), the apparent molecular mass is between 100 and 110 kDa, and has been attributed to the amino acid composition of the N-terminal domain, which is highly phosphorylated [25] ."
492,922615,"3. Infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 outbreak over-utilize governmental hospitals and non-communicable disease units in health care centers, hence access to care is diminished for diabetic patients. Admission to hospitals for diabetic patients who need care is proven difficult. Admissions to hospitals are restricted to a specific number of hospitals. Moreover, the hospital requires documentation from the patient to prove a negative COVID-test before allowing admission. This adds to the cost of care, which might further complicate receiving care for diabetic patients. 4 . Routine diabetic care is significantly impaired during the current epidemic. Many outpatient clinics and training units have been closed. Many private clinics of endocrinologists are also temporarily shut down. This leaves the private sector to provide emergency services to non-COVID patients, only. Many patients can't use such private services due to a lack of insurance or facility to pay for services. 5. Due to the fear of illness, patients do not visit a few opened laboratories to monitor their blood sugar status, and many do not have a glucometer for self -monitoring. 6 . The basis of education and treatment of diabetes in low-income countries is limited to a faceto-face visit of the endocrinologist or primary care provider.

494,2035524,"Although hMPV may be grown in tertiary monkey kidney cells, Vero cells, LLC-MK2-cells, BEAS-2B cells, A549 cells and HepG2 cells, yields are often low and require prolonged incubation. 248 Cytopathic effects typically can be observed after 10-21 days and range from syncytia formation to rounding of the cells. 254 Direct immunofluorescence assays (DFA) with virus-specific antibodies are available and allow detection of virus in direct patient specimens and cell culture. DFA is less sensitive than PCR but is often more widely available. 248 Molecular diagnostics, as either a singleplex or multiplex assay, are commercially available and have the highest yield in detecting hMPV. Most PCR assays detect all hMPV genotypes and rely on conserved and essential regions within the N, F or L gene. 248, 261 The sensitivity varies by assay and is lower for most multiplex assays as compared to singleplex assays. Serologic diagnosis can be made by ELISA methods but is not widely available. 248 Clinical Manifestations hMPV is associated with respiratory tract infections in all age groups. Among children, the most common symptoms are rhinorrhea, cough or fever, although conjunctivitis, vomiting, diarrhea and rash have been reported infrequently. 262 Encephalitis is a rare manifestation of hMPV infection. 263, 264 Although hMPV and RSV are generally indistinguishable, fever is more frequent in children with hMPV, while rhinorrhea is more commonly observed in RSV-infected individuals. 248, 265 Children appear to be at higher risk of developing bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and possibly asthma exacerbation, particularly when younger than 2 years of age. Most hospitalizations are the result of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children. Coinfection with hMPV and RSV results in more severe disease and an increased risk for admission to the ICU and a 10-fold increase in the need for mechanical ventilation. 266 The typical duration of symptoms is around a week with viral shedding typically for 1-2 weeks. 254, 255 Repeat infection has clearly been documented although subsequent infections are typically limited to recipients, which may contribute to nosocomial spread. 214 Progression to the lower respiratory tract complicates 13-43% of cases and is associated with enhanced mortality. 175, [214] [215] [216] [217] [218] [219] Rarely, lower airway involvement will be characterized by small peribronchial nodules on CT radiography. 220 Steroids, in a dose dependent manner, are associated with increased risk of progression from upper to lower tract disease and mortality. 217, 221, 222 Other risk factors for progressive disease include onset early post-transplant, allogeneic (matched unrelated and matched related) donor, presence of lymphocytopenia, active graftversus-host disease and pediatric age group. 174, 175, 221, 223 Reduced intensity conditioning appears to be a risk factor for late onset (≥ 30 days) PIV infection. 223 PIV infection is associated with a 17.9 greater odds of developing severe airflow declines following infection. 224 Parainfluenza has also been demonstrated to cause severe disease in patients undergoing chemotherapy, with enhanced risk of progression to severe lower respiratory infection in patients with severe lymphocytopenia. 225, 226 Parainfluenza virus infections among lung transplant recipients have been associated with significant short-and long-term pulmonary dysfunction. 71, 227 In addition to local acute, direct virologic effects on the lung of transplant recipients, PIV, particularly with lower tract infection, is associated with development or progression of bronchiolitis obliterans or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). 71, [227] [228] [229] [230] "
495,3071620,"The human respiratory tract is heavily exposed to microorganisms. Viral respiratory tract pathogens, like RSV, influenza and rhinoviruses cause major morbidity and mortality from respiratory tract disease.

We have used a metagenomic sequencing strategy to characterize viruses, as this provides the most unbiased view of the samples. Virus enrichment followed by 454 sequencing resulted in totally 703,790 reads and 110,931 of these were found to be of viral origin by using an automated classification pipeline. The snapshot of the respiratory tract virome of these 210 patients revealed 39 species and many more strains of viruses.

502,286181,"In order to investigate whether each factor of population structure plays an important role in determining efficient vaccination strategy, we perform numerical experiments under different settings of contact rates and subgroup sizes. We assume a 50% vaccination coverage, a 1.5% maximum daily administration of the total population and R 0 = 1.9. First, we consider two subgroups of the fixed ratio 3:7 of sizes where the former subgroup has a higher contact than the latter. The mixing rates are varied by using different frequencies of contacts a ij between jth and ith subgroups. Fig. 2A2-C2 . Under the optimal vaccination, control efforts are gradually decreasing in time. Vaccination is highly concentrated in the early stage of epidemic for early possible strategy and the vaccinated proportion stays constant over the time for uniform distribution. A larger fraction is vaccinated in the higher contact group compared to the lower contact group under the optimal strategy. In contrast, the number of individuals vaccinated in each subgroup is proportional to the size of subgroup for both early possible and uniform strategy, or the proportion vaccinated in each subgroup is kept the same. This is because neither of them reflects the heterogeneous mixing rates to determine the vaccination schedule. Fig. 2A3 -C3 demonstrate that the implementation of control measures yields substantial reductions in the peak size of infections while generating shifted, longer pandemic durations. The reduction of cumulative number of infectives relative to the case without intervention are approximately 68.2%, 59%, 45.5% under optimal, early possible, and uniform distribution, respectively (Fig. 2A4-C4 ). This result proposes that control measures may be optimally targeted to minimize the number of cases for a given control effort."
503,203210,"Our study illustrates that the innate immune response to PEDV is cell type-specific, with macrophages responding via IFN-␣/IFN-␤ response, whereas the epithelial cell response includes IFN-. It is important to note that infection with wild-type PEDV does elicit IFN responses from epithelial cells and macrophages, but the timing of the IFN response is delayed and the magnitude of IFN levels is lower than that in PEDV-EndoU mutant virus infection (Fig. 3) . The earlier IFN response elicited by icPEDV-EnUmt infection results in the transcription of a series of ISGs that are known to induce an antiviral state and thereby limit propagation of the invading pathogen. We also report detection of reduced virus shedding and mortality in piglets infected with icPEDV-EnUmt compared to that in piglets infected with the isogenic wild-type strain ( Fig. 6B and C). These results suggest that activation of an early innate immune response alters virus replication and pathogenesis, but additional in vivo research is needed to fully investigate this issue. For example, the in vivo response to CoV infection may differ, depending on the dose of the virus and the age of the animal. It will also be important to evaluate the frequency of reversion of EndoU mutants and to employ strategies to make these viruses recombination resistant (38) . It is possible that the pathology we detected at day 7 in the icPEDV-EnUmt-infected animals could be generated by revertant viruses (Fig. 7) . Future studies using viruses containing multiple mutations in EndoU, which are thus less likely to revert, should be evaluated at multiple time points to determine the extent of virus replication and the local immune response. For coronaviruses that encode multiple IFN antagonists, it will be interesting to evaluate the role of each antagonist on the type I and type III IFN responses and to determine if inactivating a constellation of antagonists, perhaps both the highly conserved nonstructural protein antagonists and accessory proteins, may be necessary to fully attenuate endemic and emerging strains (29, 39, 40) ."
504,2922859,"Notably, recent studies have demonstrated that several viral proteins encoded by coronaviruses (CoV), such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV and mouse hepatitis virus, can modulate innate antiviral signaling Lui et al., 2016; Thornbrough et al., 2016) . Relying on its proteinase activity, CoV non-structural protein 5 (nsp5), also called 3C-like protease or main protease, is responsible for processing the viral polyprotein to produce most of the non-structural proteins during viral replication (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Masters, 2006; Perlman and Netland, 2009; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The 3C-like protease of the Arterivirus porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and the 3 C proteases of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV), both of which belong to the Picornaviridae family, are reported to impair innate immune signaling (Huang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2012 Wang et al., , 2014 . A study published by our lab also demonstrated that nsp5, the 3C-like protease of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which is classified into the Alphacoronavirus family, antagonizes IFN-β production by cleavage of NEMO . Recently, our research has shown that infection with PDCoV inhibits RIG-I-mediated IFN signaling, although the specific inhibition mechanism remains poorly understood . As such, we were extremely interested to discover whether nsp5 of PDCoV could disrupt type I IFN signaling."
505,2932344,"Gammacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae [4] . It is an important viral pathogen affecting chickens of all ages. The IBV virion is enveloped, and it genome is a positive-sense, non-segmented, single-stranded RNA molecule of approximately 27.6 kb [16] . Gene 1 comprises approximately two-thirds of the genome and encodes two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which are translated as the large polyprotein 1ab. Protein 1ab can be divided into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) and is associated with RNA replication and transcription. The remaining one-third of the genome encodes the four main structural proteins: the spike (S) glycoprotein and the envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. There are also two accessory genes interspersed amongst the structural protein genes, genes 3 and 5, which encode the small non-structural proteins 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b [7, 14] . IBV is a coronavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome, and it has high genetic variability through spontaneous mutations and genetic recombination [5] . The viral genome is prone to point mutations, insertions, deletions or recombination, resulting in the appearance of a large number of IBV variants, which confer little or no crossprotection against each other [15] ."

Some FCV strains have the ability to actively replicate in the enteric tract and have been occasionally detected in fecal specimens of cats (Radford et al., 2007) .

508,1614411,"Whether the appearance of pathological T cells in adult patients with severe COVID-19 diseases is due to the compensation for this fundamental aging process or not is unclear. At the early stage after birth, CD4 + T cells are impaired in production of Th1 associated proinflammatory cytokines and skewed toward Th2 (67) . CD8 + T cells reduced expression of cytotoxic and inflammatory mediators. Less killing ability by T cells at early stage after birth may explain susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in infants. The study comparing aged and young macaques infected with SARS-CoV showed that aged macaques had more robust proinflammatory responses with worse lung pathology (68) . A similar result was reported using aged and young mice infected with SARS-CoV (69) .Severe COVID-19 infection is characterized by a massive proinflammatory response or cytokine storm that results in ARDS and multi-organ dysfunction (MODS). It has been also suggested that inflammatory responses in adults and children are much different (70) . Ageing is associated with increasing proinflammatory cytokines that J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f govern neutrophil functions and have been correlated with the severity of ARDS. So far there is no animal model for SARS-CoV-2, but we expect to see a preclinical model in the future."

C1-INH controls the activity of the classical pathway by binding to the C1 complex and initiating the diffusion of the fragments C1r and C1s. This process leads to an irreversible inactivation of the initiating serine protease. As the classical and the lectin pathway resemble each other in many ways, the C1-INH also inactivates MASP-1 and -2, thereby also inhibiting the lectin pathway. As well as inactivating complement components, C1-INH also blocks certain parts of the kinin, fibrinolytic and coagulation systems, such as coagulation factors XII and IX."

512,2776806,"The clinical specimens used for our studies were collected during the peak of an influenza season in February and March 2008 in order to gain more information about isolation rates in MDCK 33016PF cells in suspension culture. The results of those studies will be published elsewhere. Considering the selection of specimens, the high percentage of influenza-positive results is not surprising, but a significant number of samples (66/370 or 17.8%) also tested positive for other viruses, such as adenovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, metapneumovirus (HMPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Except for RSV and PIV, the same viruses were also detected as co-infections together with influenza virus. Such co-infections together with influenza viruses have also been published previously for RSV [23] [24] [25] , PIV [23] , HMPV [25, 26] , and for adenovirus and bocavirus [24] , although the overall frequency was comparatively low. Those previous reports were all based on PCR detection methods, applying a more restricted virus spectrum than the ResPlex II method. We were unable to find reports about co-infections of influenza virus with other viruses identified via cell culture isolation methods, although such double-infected study materials have certainly been used in high numbers. This indicates that cell cultures selectively support replication of specific viruses and that, in addition, the virus identification methods used were less specific or less sensitive than PCR-based methods."
513,454514,"The standard hygiene and social distancing measures should continue to be pursued. Visits to the inpatient setting should be limited or completely restricted. Patients should also be reminded to take extra precautions by practicing good hand hygiene, social distancing, and wearing a mask and gloves when leaving their homes. Patients' outpatient schedules need to be designed to minimize exposure and presence in the clinic (e.g., less fre-Acta Haematol DOI: 10.1159/000508199 quent blood tests, more frequent telemedicine or phone calls, lower thresholds for transfusions of blood or platelet products). If patients need to come for bloodwork or clinic visits, attempts should be made to minimize crowds by prolonging time between appointments and encouraging social distancing. Patients who typically travel a long distance for laboratory or clinic visits should have care coordinated with a local oncologist at a facility equipped to administer chemotherapy and blood products whenever possible. Patients with acute leukemia should receive appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, including antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents, during periods of neutropenia. The empiric use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) to prevent secondary infections in patients is not routinely recommended given the unlikely acquired humoral immunity of donors against COVID-19 at this early time point in the pandemic and the potential prothrombotic risk associated with IVIG administration. In addition, IVIG is ineffective as a single agent against COVID-19 [70, 71] . Therefore, the use of IVIG should be limited to patients who have active or recurrent severe infections and IgG levels < 400-500 mg/dL."
514,1174004,"Here, we describe the development of a new strategy for functional siRNA delivery to cells by loading siRNA into liposomes bearing arginine octamer molecules attached to the liposome surface (R8-liposomes). R8 belongs to a large group of so-called cell-penetrating peptides (CPP), which are positively charged and can enter cells when added exogenously [18] . Various CPPs have been successfully used for the delivery of exogenous molecules, such as oligonucleotides and proteins, and even small particles, such as iron oxide nanoparticles, liposomes, and quantum dots, into the cytoplasm and nuclei of cultured cells [6] [7] [8] [9] 19 ]. Thus, DNA-loaded liposomes were delivered into various cells by multiple TAT peptide molecules attached to the liposome surface and allowed for the successful transfection with TAT-liposome-DNA complexes both in vitro and in vivo [20] . Synthetic oligo-arginines, such as 9-mer and 8mer (R8), were shown to be very effective CPPs [21] allowing, for example, for successful cell transfection with R8-luciferaseencoding plasmid complexes [22] ."
515,555693,"The global pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 3.5 million people worldwide and led to more than 250,000 deaths within just 5 months of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China. 1 The rapid spread of the virus is largely the result of community transmission by individuals who are asymptomatic. 2 While some individuals remain asymptomatic throughout the disease course 3 others develop a flu-like illness with viral pneumonia which may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, viral sepsis 4 , and cytokine storm. 5 The latter has raised clinical concerns for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and the overlapping disorder, macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), highlighting the potential for therapeutic cytokine blockade.

519,2412994,"One of the most striking differences in this and other comparative analysis is the high median age of H7N9 patients [16] . This age distribution is unlikely to be due to differences in humoral immunity as the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to H7N9 virus is probably low in all ages [17] [18] [19] [20] . It might arise either because elderly people are more often exposed to the animal or environmental reservoir of H7N9 viruses, or because elderly people have a greater propensity to become infected or severely ill following exposure. After adjusting for the age-and sex-specific prevalence of chronic illnesses in the general Chinese population, we found that CHD was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 virus infection (RR, 9.68; 95% CI, 5.24-17.9). The age distribution of H7N9 patients may therefore be partially explained by an increased propensity in persons with CHD (who are mostly older) to develop severe disease following infection with H7N9 virus. The overrepresentation of males among H7N9 patients may also be partially explained by this association, because in China coronary heart disease is commoner in males than females (male prevalence, 0.74%; female prevalence, 0.51%) [10] . In agreement with our results, an age-and sex-matched case control study of 25 H7N9 cases has reported that the presence of a preexisting chronic medical condition (excluding hypertension) was associated with H7N9 disease (odds ratio, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.5-16.9) [21] . Although only 11% of H7N9 patients reported a history of CHD, unrecognized CHD may have been present in some individuals, and other unmeasured age-related factors, such as impaired innate and cell-mediated immunity, might also contribute to the observed age distribution of hospitalized H7N9 cases [17, 22, 23] . H7N9 viruses isolated from humans exhibit a mixed receptor specificity, binding both α2-6and α2-3linked sialidases [3, 4, 20] . H7N9 virus can infect cells of both the upper and lower respiratory tract of humans and ferrets, and disease in ferrets is more severe following intratracheal inoculation [5, 6, 20] . This raises the possibility that susceptibility of humans to severe H7N9 disease may be a consequence of an impaired ability to control virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. A history of chronic renal disease was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization with H7N9 virus infection, but the number of patients with this condition was small, so this finding should be interpreted with caution. A history of smoking was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization with H7N9, H5N1, and pH1N1 virus infections. This is an unexpected finding that might be biased by inconsistent definitions and methods of ascertaining smoking history, which were not standardized in the clinical datasets."

There are, so far, six 12 The seroprevalence and transmissibility of MERS-CoV remain undetermined, although animal-to-human and human-to-human transmissions both appear to be limited at this stage (Fig. 1) . Among 2400 persons seeking medical attention in a hospital in Jeddah, KSA, none had MERS-CoVspecific IgG detectable by indirect immunofluorescence assay, suggesting that the current situation is likely to be different from those of other human coronaviruses which are endemic in humans. 6, 38 The lack of secondary cases among nearly 200 contacts of Cases 2 and 5 who did not practice optimal infection control measures before the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed, implied that this novel virus might be less efficient than SARS-CoV in human-tohuman transmission. 7, 13, 39 However, the findings of these studies should be interpreted with cautions for two reasons. First, only a relatively small number of subjects (10/64 in Case 2 and 85/123 in Case 5) were tested by reliable laboratory tests. Second, the timing of testing was not clearly described and might be suboptimal for the purpose of excluding the diagnosis. It has been proposed that a second test should be performed in symptomatic patients with initially negative results by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), within the first 10 days of symptom onset, based on the observation in SARS where viral load peaked at day 10 of symptom onset. 5,40e42 Therefore, the apparently limited spread of MERS-CoV at present might be an underestimation and ongoing transmission of the virus should be cautiously monitored."

525,2035506,"Adenovirus disease in immunocompromised adults and children ranges from asymptomatic shedding to progressive, often fatal disseminated disease. 28, [60] [61] [62] [63] Risk factors for adenoviral infection in the HSCT population includes allogeneic donor (8.5-30% vs 2-12% for autologous donor), pediatric age groups (20-47% vs 9-13.6% for adults), T cell-depleted grafts (45% vs 11%), use of alemtuzumab, cord blood donor and patients with acute graft-versus-host disease Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan and Canada in a matter of weeks; at the end of the 6-month epidemic, more than 30 countries were affected, resulting in 8096 confirmed infections, and 774 deaths (9.6%). 87 The primary mode of transmission was via respiratory droplets; the basic reproductive number (R0) of SARS was in the range of 2.2-3.7. 79, 82, 87 However, frequent nosocomial outbreaks and 'superspreading events' had greatly exacerbated its transmission. 88 Notably, 21% of SARS victims were healthcare workers; and the disease attack rate in hospitals was between 10% and 60%. 78,82 Viral kinetics (peak at the time of clinical deterioration), application of aerosol-generating procedures and devices (e.g. intubation, resuscitation, oxygen or nebulizer therapy, bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)), overcrowdedness and lack of proper isolation facilities in hospitals are some of the explanations. [88] [89] [90] A community 'super-spreading event' that occurred in a private housing estate in Hong Kong involved over 300 residents. Drying up of a 'U-shaped' bathroom floor drain and backflow of contaminated sewage (from a SARS patient with diarrhea), coupled with the toilet's exhaust fan, might have created infectious aerosols that rose with warm air along the building's air-shaft; these were then dispersed by wind flow, causing long-range transmission to nearby buildings. 90 This and other evidence suggested that SARS could be 'opportunistically' airborne. 78, 89 The first cases of MERS-CoV infections emerged in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia and Qatar. As of May 2015, a total of 1180 confirmed infections and 483 (41%) deaths had been reported. 78, 91 The Middle Eastern countries of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan and United Arab Emirates were predominantly affected, but imported cases to UK, Netherlands, USA and Asia were reported. 91, 291 The largest outbreak outside the Middle East occurred in South Korea in 2015, which involved multiple hospitals and 185 individuals, causing 36 (19.5%) deaths. Although zoonotic transmission is implicated, the majority of infected cases did not report a history of direct animal contact. Epidemiological investigations suggested sporadic transmission of disease with multiple introductions into the at-risk population. It was found that occupational exposure to camels (e.g. shepherds, slaughter-house works) was associated with 15-23 times higher risk of seroconversion (2.3-3.6%) than the general population (<0.2%). Also, a large number of younger (15-44 years) infected individuals, who develop no or mild symptoms might exist and serve as the source of infection for those without direct animal contact. 78, 91, 92, 292 Secondary transmission in household is not uncommon, which occur in over 20% of case clusters. Transmission is typically highly efficient in the hospital settings via infectious droplets/aerosols, leading to frequent occurrence of nosocomial outbreaks, as in the case of SARS. 78, [93] [94] [95] [96] 293, 294 Pathogenicity The cellular receptor for HCoV-229E is aminopeptidase N (APN) or CD13; the cellular receptor for HCoV-OC43 is 9-O-acetylated sialic acid on the cell surface. Like SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 binds to the ACE2. 85 Humans have no pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. These novel viruses have the ability to evade innate host defenses (e.g. type I interferon responses and related mechanisms), and replicate efficiently in host tissues (respiratory and intestinal tract cells; kidney cells also for MERS-CoV). 78, 80, 82, 83 In addition to lytic cell damage, uncontrolled replication of SARS-CoV leads to unabated inflammatory cytokine activation (commonly known as 'cytokine storms'), which is implicated in the development of progressive pneumonitis, diffuse alveolar damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hemophagocytic syndrome. 79, 97 High viral load and slow viral clearance due to inefficient host responses are associated with progressive disease and fatal outcomes. 82, 98, 99 Pathogenesis data for MERS-CoV are limited; a macaque model has shown active viral replication in lung tissues causing localized-to-widespread lesions and clinical illness, which only abates after 1 week of illness. Infected marmosets can develop severe interstitial pneumonia similar to humans cases. Neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and alveolar oedema are noted. 78, 100, 101 (GVHD). 4, 28, [63] [64] [65] Although disseminated disease only effects 1-7% of HSCT recipients it is associated with a significant risk of mortality (8-26%). 4, 28, 63, 66 Incidence among solid organ transplant recipient populations is highest in small bowel and liver transplant recipients, pediatric transplant recipients, patients who receive antilymphocyte antibodies, and patients with donor-positive/recipient-negative adenovirus status. 60 Asymptomatic adenovirus DNAemia is common among solid organ transplant recipients and generally is not associated with progression to symptomatic disease. 67, 68 Management Although no antivirals are specifically approved for the treatment of adenovirus, several have in vitro and in vivo experimental data to support their use. 4 63,69-73 While no single agent has consistently been effective in all cases, existing data suggest that cidofovir and its lipid ester analogs (CMX001 or brincidofovir) are most effective in managing adenovirus infections. 4, 63, 74 Adenovirus-and multi-virus-specific T cells are an emerging potential therapy that can safely be used with a low frequency of de novo graft-versus-host disease and a complete or partial response in the adenovirus infection. 75, 76 Serial measurement of quantitative viral load is predictive of response to any therapeutic intervention."
526,3086985,"A retrospective viral load study was performed on clinical specimens from 154 patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); the specimens were prospectively collected during patients' illness. Viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates (n = 142) from day 10 to day 15 after onset of symptoms was associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, diarrhea, hepatic dysfunction, and death. Serum viral load (n = 53) was associated with oxygen desaturation, mechanical ventilation, and death. Stool viral load (n = 94) was associated with diarrhea, and urine viral load (n = 111) was associated with abnormal urinalysis results. Viral replications at different sites are important in the pathogenesis of clinical and laboratory abnormalities of SARS."
527,3072186,"In this study, the susceptibility of porcine peripheral blood monocytes (BMo), peritoneal macrophages (PMf) and alveolar macrophages (AMf) to PRRSV was examined. To test the effect of differentiation and activation on their susceptibility, AMf and BMo were aged, cultivated in either adhesion or suspension and treated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). It was found that freshly isolated PMf and BMo were non-permissive to PRRSV. PMf remained refractory but a few BMo became susceptible after 1 day cultivation. AMf were permissive with a signi®cant increase of their susceptibility after one day cultivation. In a binding assay, it was demonstrated that the attachment of biotinylated PRRSV to AMf is much more ef®cient than to PMf and BMo. Two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) 41D3 and 41D5 which block PRRSV infection of AMf and are directed against a candidate receptor for PRRSV only reacted with the cell membrane of AMf. PMA treatment of AMf blocked PRRSV replication in the cells in a dose-dependent manner. The blocking effect of PMA decreased after 9 h continuous pre-treatment and diminished after 24 h continuous pre-treatment. PMA treatment did not affect the binding of PRRSV and MAb 41D3 and 41D5 to AMf. Direct or indirect treatment of AMf and BMo with LPS or cultivation in suspension did not signi®cantly affect their susceptibility. These results provide clear evidence that PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for only some sub-populations of porcine monocytes/macrophages and that some speci®c states of differentiation and activation of monocytes/macrophages considerably affect their susceptibility."
528,657786,"COVID-19 has been associated with acute hemorrhagic necrotizing and hypoxic encephalopathy, encephalitis, delirium, and anosmia (1, (10) (11) (12) . Other β-coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been shown to be neurotropic and manifest with delirium(1). The ACE2 receptor (the primary source of cell entry of the virus) is expressed in both neurons and glia and could serve as a mechanism of direct viral entry into the nervous system. Alternatively, the inflammatory state itself may give rise to encephalopathy (13) and patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have been shown to have a high rate of persistent dysexecutive syndrome similar to our patient(3); however our patient was never hypoxic or severely ill prior to onset of symptoms and symptoms persisted for many days following normalization of markers of inflammation;"
529,134599,"Wheezing episodes in asthma have been clearly associated with acute infection, but the development of de novo bronchial reactivity in normal persons is much less clear. Parker et al. I8 first described abnormal methacholine responses during acute upper respiratory tract infections; however, the viral origin was not established in any case, and inasmuch as five of their 13 patients retained their abnormal response to methacholine, it is not clear whether they were normal before infection or whether the apparent ""cold"" simply worsened their underlying hyperresponsiveness. Empey et a1.26 demonstrated that bronchial responses returned to normal after as long as 3 months, but failed to identify the specific viral cause. A third study' showed abnormalities in bronchial response to exercise in cold air during acute upper respiratory tract infection. Three different agents were isolatedmycoplasma, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus-but differences with the three agents were not discussed."
530,243272,"Taken together, our results show that, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, Bcl-2 expression delayed CPE appearance, abrogated apoptosis, and partially prevented cleavage of both PARP and procaspase 8. These results indicate that in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells, apoptosis is mediated mainly by the caspase pathway. However, apoptosis appears to be a late phenomenon compared with completion of the virus replication cycle. This finding, together with the fact that the inhibition of apoptosis does not alter both kinetics, extent and release of virus progeny from cells, would imply that apoptosis is not involved in facilitating viral release and/or dissemination in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells."
531,1212379,"It is well established that the host cell receptor binding and membrane fusion occur through the S1 and S2 subunits of spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV [38] [39] [40] . SARS-CoV fusion protein or the S2 subunit belongs to the class I type fusion system that contains two heptad repeats, HR1 and HR2, and a TM domain at the C-terminus [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . HR1 and HR2 complex stabilizes six helix bundle topology or trimer-of-hairpins structure, a canonical feature shared by the class I fusion proteins [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . Interestingly, multiple regions of S2 subunit have been identified with fusogenic activity (Fig. 1 ). As seen, potential FPs are largely mapped upstream of HR1 in the S2 subunit of fusion protein (Fig. 1) . These potential FPs demonstrated vesicle fusion, membrane partitioning and membrane disordering [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . It has been proposed that the cell-cell fusion may involve a concerted action of the HR1 and HR2 along with insertion of the FPs into cell membrane [48, 50, 54] . Atomic-resolution structure of SARS-CoV FPs in membrane or in membrane mimic environment can provide mechanistic insights toward virus-cell fusion. Previously, utilizing synthetic peptides, we reported NMR structures of three potential FPs of SARS-CoV, namely residues M770-L788, residues G873-F888 and residues L1185-F1202, in DPC micelle [56] . Conceivably, during cell-cell fusion multiple FPs may insert into membrane therefore, here, we investigated a long fusion peptide (LFP) encompassing residues R758-E821 (Fig. 1) . The 64-residue LFP was over-expressed in E. coli cells as a fusion protein containing prodomain of human furin at the N-terminus and further purified. NMR structural characterization was carried out using isotopically labelled LFP in DPC detergent solution. 3D structure of LFP and localization in micelle may aid toward better understating of cellcell fusion and perhaps assist in antiviral drug development."
532,619282,"Here, S i , I i , and R i (i = 1, . . . , n) are the proportions of the population in patch i that are susceptible, infectious recovered, respectively. Summing Eqs. (26), we see that S i (t) + I i (t) + R i (t) = 1 is invariant in all patches. We denote by N i the number of individuals in patch i, so the total population size is N = i N i . It is also convenient to use B = (β i j ) to denote the n × n transmission matrix. Similar to our analysis of other models in previous sections, it is straightforward to prove that S i (∞), R i (∞), I i (∞) exist, that S i (∞) + R i (∞) = 1 and that I i (∞) = 0. Since β i j ≥ 0, the dominant eigenvalue λ of B is real and positive (Horn and Johnson, 1985) . If we linearize the model (26) at the disease free equilibrium (DFE) (S i = 1, I i = 0, R i = 0), we see that the stability of the DFE is determined by λ. If λ/γ > 1, then the DFE is unstable, otherwise it is stable. Thus, the threshold for exponential growth of cases (an epidemic) is determined by the value of R 0 = λ/γ , which can be interpreted as the basic reproduction number (van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002) ."
533,3090564,"Norovirus (NoV) RNA was detected in the stools of 6 out 14 (42.8%) 8-12-week-old cats with enteritis from a feline shelter, in New York State. Upon sequence analysis of the complete capsid, the six NoVs were found to be identical, suggesting the spread of a unique NoV strain in the shelter. The full-length genomic sequence (7839 nt) of one feline NoV, CU081210E/ 2010/US, was determined. In the capsid protein VP1 region, the virus displayed the highest amino acid identity to animal genogroup IV genotype 2 (GIV.2) NoVs: lion/Pistoia-387/06/IT (97.9%) and dog/Bari-170/07/IT (90.4%). These findings document the discovery of a novel feline calicivirus, different from vesiviruses, and extend the spectrum of NoV host range. Epidemiological studies using feline NoV-specific diagnostic tools and experimental infection of cats are required to understand whether NoVs have a pathogenic role in this species."
534,2120253,"For over half a century, numerous studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of various antiviral agents and immunomodulatory drugs against FIPV infection, but most were to no avail [7] [8] [9] . The viral inhibitory effect of chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, has been investigated in vitro and in vivo; it could inhibit FIPV replication and reduce inflammatory cytokine levels, yet it caused severe adverse effects when used at higher dosages [10] . Vaccination against FIPV had promoted its infectivity to cats rather than providing protection, particularly because the existence of nonneutralising antibodies had facilitated FIPV infection [11, 12] . DNA vaccines were incapable of inducing cellmediated immunity against FIPV challenge, and coadministration of interleukin-(IL-) 12 with the vaccines further caused adverse effects to the cats [13] . Nevertheless, a recent study showed itraconazole, a common antifungal drug, was effective for inhibiting infection by type I FCoV [14] . Other promising anti-FIPV drugs, e.g., GC376 3C-like protease inhibitor and nucleoside analogue GS-441524, were reported to have significant antiviral effects in naturally occurring FIP in cats [15, 16] ."
535,3144769,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been the first severe contagious disease to emerge in the 21st century. The available epidemic curves for SARS show marked differences between the affected regions with respect to the total number of cases and epidemic duration, even for those regions in which outbreaks started almost simultaneously and similar control measures were implemented at the same time. The authors developed a likelihood-based estimation procedure that infers the temporal pattern of effective reproduction numbers from an observed epidemic curve. Precise estimates for the effective reproduction numbers were obtained by applying this estimation procedure to available data for SARS outbreaks that occurred in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada in 2003. The effective reproduction numbers revealed that epidemics in the various affected regions were characterized by markedly similar disease transmission potentials and similar levels of effectiveness of control measures. In controlling SARS outbreaks, timely alerts have been essential: Delaying the institution of control measures by 1 week would have nearly tripled the epidemic size and would have increased the expected epidemic duration by 4 weeks."

538,3100373,"Objective: Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods: Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results: Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical"
539,1427775,"In our analyses, use of either ACE inhibitors or statins was associated with better survival among patients with Covid-19. However, these associations should be considered with extreme caution. Because our study was not a randomized, controlled trial, we cannot exclude the possibility of confounding. In addition, we examined relationships between many variables and in-hospital death, and no primary hypothesis was prespecified; these factors increased the probability of chance associations being found. Therefore, a cause-and-effect relationship between drug ther-apy and survival should not be inferred. These data also offer no information concerning the potential effect of initiation of ACE inhibitor or statin therapy in patients with Covid-19 who do not have an appropriate indication for these medications. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of ACE inhibitors and statins will be necessary before any conclusion can be reached regarding a potential benefit of these agents in patients with In this multinational observational study involving patients hospitalized with Covid-19, we confirmed previous observations suggesting that underlying cardiovascular disease is independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital death. We were not able to confirm previous concerns regarding a potential harmful association of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with in-hospital mortality in this clinical context."
540,1981843,"Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug which acts to raise lysosomal pH, leading to inhibition of both the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes and lysosomal protein degradation. Chloroquine has in vitro activity against both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza strains at concentrations achievable in vivo at the doses used for malaria prophylaxis and treatment of connective-tissue diseases (Ooi et al., 2006; Di Trani et al., 2007) . Chloroquine did not prevent influenza infection nor diminish weight loss in mice infected with a mouse-adapted influenza A(H1N1) strain, and had only minimal activity in limiting viral replication in ferrets infected with an adapted A(H3N2) strain (Vigerust and McCullers, 2007) . Chloroquine inhibited autophagy in mouse lung induced by A(H5N1) but viral loads and proinflammatory cytokines were not significantly affected . The major side effects of chloroquine in humans include headache, diarrhea, nausea and blurred vision. Furthermore, it did not prevent influenza infection in a healthy community population (Paton et al., 2011) . The limited published data put chloroquine and its derivatives at a lower priority to be evaluated as a candidate drug for clinical treatment of severe influenza."
541,2202505,"Human infections by bunyavirus can be severe and eventually fatal. New world hantaviruses (Andes Virus and Sin Nombre Virus) cause pulmonary syndrome while the Old word hantaviruses (Hantaan virus) cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) with renal syndrome reaching fatality rates of 50% and 1-15% respectively. Another relevant example is CCHFV, one of the most virulent and enigmatic bunyaviruses. In humans, CCHFV infection causes severe HF with mortality rates typically between 20 and 30% (Bente et al., 2013) , this is particularly tragic taking into account that each year more than 1000 human cases are reported from countries of southeastern Europe and Turkey. In contrast, naturally infected animals do not appear to develop noticeable clinical symptoms, despite in viral endemic areas seropositivity can be detected in many mammalian species including bats (Hoogstraal, 1979) . Phlebovirus infections (e.g. RVFV) or Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus (SFTSV)), cause fevers that can be mild but can also result in severe HF, ocular disease, thrombocytopenia or encephalitis reaching fatality rates of 12-30% (Elliott and Brennan, 2014; Zhao et al., 2012) ."
542,1946760,"To examine the effect of ribavirin on porcine nidovirus replication, PRRSV and PEDV were selected because they are important viral pathogens that economically affect the swine industry. Based on MTT assay, none of the doses of ribavirin tested in the present study caused detectable cell death of PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells (data not shown). PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells were pretreated with ribavirin at concentrations of 10-50 M or 10-200 M, respectively, or with DW as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. Ribavirin was present during the entire period of infection. Viral production was initially measured by monitoring the cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection and confirmed by immunofluorescence using N protein-specific MAb at 48 hpi (Fig. 1) . In vehicle-treated control cells, visible CPE appeared at 24 hpi and became predominant by 48 hpi, and N-specific staining was clearly evident in many cell clusters, indicating infection and the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. In contrast, ribavirin had an obvious inhibitory effect on virus propagation. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, ribavirin significantly decreased virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression of PRRSV and PEDV at concentrations of ∼10 M and ∼50 M, respectively. N protein staining revealed that the number of cells expressing viral antigen, as quantified by N protein staining results, was also reduced during ribavirin treatment, resulting in a maximum of ∼80% inhibition in response to 50 M and 200 M for PRRSV and PEDV, respectively ( Fig. 1A and B) . Moreover, the effective doses for inhibiting 50% (ED 50 ) of the replication of PRRSV and PEDV were determined to be about 21 M and 73 M, respectively. Taken together, these data demonstrate that ribavirin efficiently suppresses the replication of porcine nidoviruses."
543,1628798,"The etiological agent of this new infection is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [2] . Availability and reliability of robust assays providing sensitive identification of infected individuals are the first steps allowing patient isolation, diagnosis and proper therapeutic measures. Several in-house and commercial RT-PCR assays have been quickly developed [3] but still require to be independently assessed and evaluated. The RealStare® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit (Altona) is a Research Usage Only (RUO) product providing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and compatible with various real-time PCR platforms. It allows detection and differentiation of lineage B-betacoronavirus (B-ßCoV), by targeting the E gene from B-ßCoV, and SARS-CoV-2 specific RNA, by targeting the S gene. Evaluating the sensitivity of RT-PCR assays is an essential point as very low viral loads can be identified in patients nasopharyngeal swabs, especially in later disease stages [4, 5] . To date, the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 assay has been compared to several other commercial assay [6, 7] , however thorough limit of detection assessment and performances comparison with the currently WHO recommended assay have not been provided."
544,2039404,"However,3CL PRO was highly expressed almost immediately after viral inoculation, increasing to 2.08 Â 10 5 copies mL À 1 at 1.5 h, while POL showed a modest expression (ffi 10 2 copies mL À 1 ). Afterwards both transcripts displayed similar increasing rates, but maintained the 3CL PRO /POL ratio around 10 3 . Likewise, GP116 and GP64 are encoded by ORF3, but di¡erent concentrations of their corresponding transcripts were detected, mainly between 24 and 48 h, when the concentration of the GP64 transcript rapidly increased (Fig. 4) . These disparities could not be explained due to the poorly understood replication and transcription mechanisms in Nidovirales where sub-genomic mRNA and double-stranded RNA intermediates, as well as the poorly described non-structural proteins seem to be implicated (Pasternak et al. 2006; Enjuanes, Sola, Zun ì iga & Moreno 2007) . The importance of 3CL PRO for Nidovirales replication has been corroborated by the silencing of this gene in YHV-infected P. monodon, which caused a strong inhibition of viral replication, whereas silencing GP116 and GP64 was less e⁄cient (Ziebuhr et al. 2003; Tirasophon, Roshorm & Panyim 2005; Yodmuang,Tirasophon, Roshorm, Chinnirunvong & Panyim 2006; Tirasophon, Yodmuang, Chinnirunvong, Plongthongkum & Panyim 2007) . As shown in Fig. 4 , 3CL PRO is highly expressed early, perhaps because this protein is required for creating other functional viral proteins by proteolytic cleavage (Ziebuhr et al. 2000) . On the other hand, transcripts of the structural glycoproteins GP116 and GP64 also showed di¡erent concentrations. This could be due to di¡erences in the hydrolytic action of RNases where polyA tails have a degradation-protective role (de Vries et al. 1997; Pasternak et al. 2006) ."
545,50480,"Health care systems all over the world have been facing major and unprecedented challenges since the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 . Extensive restrictions and nation-wide lockdowns were implemented to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Its special features contributed to its fast and widespread transmission, including (1) being highly contagious, (2) the possible transmission from asymptomatic individuals and (3) causing mild symptoms in most of the infected patients [1, 2] . Some countries were unexpectedly overwhelmed by a considerable increase in patients admitted to hospitals in need of intensive care [3] . Meanwhile, a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in conjunction with limited bed capacities at intensive care units (ICU) resulted in suspension of elective surgeries. PPE and ICU beds were urgently needed as scarce medical resources for the management of COVID-19 cases and for the protection of the medical staff [4, 5] . Another reason for postponing elective surgeries was the fear that patients admitted to hospital for elective surgery would become vectors for the transmission of a nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2 [3, 4] ."

547,612255,"Receptor expression levels can limit HIV entry into host cells [6, 7] , and this limitation can be overcome by concentrating virions onto target cells by, for example, centrifugation or polybrene treatment [8] . A constantly accumulating body of evidence suggests that certain host cell factors can also promote viral attachment to cells and can thereby increase infection efficiency [9, 10] . A striking example is the interaction of HIV with a semen-derived fragment of prostatic acidic phosphatase, termed SEVI (for Semen Enhancer of Virus Infection) [11] . SEVI, an amyloidogenic peptide, forms fibrils in human semen which capture HIV and concentrate virions onto target cells [11] . As a consequence, SEVI boosts viral infectivity and might increase the risk of acquiring HIV infection upon sexual intercourse. Incorporation of host cell factors into the HIV envelope can also increase viral infectivity. The augmentation of infectivity is due to the interaction of the virion-incorporated factors with their cognate receptors on HIV target cells, as exemplified by the up to 100-fold increased infectivity of ICAM-1-bearing viruses for LFA-1 positive target cells [12, 13] . Finally, attachment of HIV to dendritic cells can also promote HIV infection of adjacent T-cells [14, 15] , and this property has been associated with the expression of DC-SIGN [16] , a calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin which recognizes mannose-rich carbohydrates on the HIV Env protein [17] [18] [19] . Engineered expression of DC-SIGN on certain cell lines promotes receptor-dependent infection of these cells (termed infection in cis) [20] or of adjacent target cells (termed infection in trans, or transmission) [16] , and it has been suggested that DC-SIGN might promote HIV spread in and between individuals [16] . However, this hypothesis is intensely debated [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that DC-SIGN might mainly function as a pathogen recognition receptor, which promotes HIV uptake for MHC presentation and thereby exerts a protective function against HIV infection [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] ."
548,400661,"In summary, we have demonstrated that a short peptide derived from mBD4 has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subtypes of influenza A virus including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7 and H7N9, as well as two coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The antiviral effect of P9 is mediated through the following mechanism: (1) P9 efficiently binds to viral particles via viral glycoproteins and (2) P9 is rich in basic amino acids, which prevent acidification in endosomes and inhibit viral RNA release. Influenza A virus and coronavirus have caused several fatal pandemics and outbreaks in the past century. Although a number of anti-influenza drugs have been developed, drug-resistant virus strains emerged quickly after these antiviral drugs were put in clinical use. In addition, thus far, no effective antiviral drugs are available for patients infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV 5 . In this regard, antiviral peptides, such as P9, represent new promising prophylactic and therapeutic agents with broad-spectrum antiviral activities. Overall, based on the mechanism illustrated in this study, new antiviral peptides with broad-spectrum antiviral activities may be developed to provide new drugs for prophylaxis and therapy of viral infections. Cloning, expression and purification of rmBD4. The codons of mBD4 were optimized to E. coli-preferred codons based on OPTIMIZER 34 (Supplementary Fig. 7a ). The fragment of mBD4 was generated by PCR-based gene synthesis using 6 oligos ( Supplementary Fig. 7b) . The codon-optimized gene was cloned into PCR2.1 vector and then sub-cloned into PET32a(+ ) at KpnI and XhoI sites. The resulting plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) to express thioredoxin-mBD4 fusion protein. Thioredoxin-mBD4 (Trx-mBD4) was released from E. coli by a simple osmotic shock procedure 35 and further purified by AKTA-FPLC (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) using His Trap FF column (GE Healthcare) ( Supplementary  Fig. 7c ). Trx-mBD4 was digested with enterokinase to release recombinant mBD4 (rmBD4). rmBD4 was recovered by cation-exchange chromatography using Sp sepharose FF (GE Healthcare). Purified rmBD4 was desalted using PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) into 25 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) (Supplementary Fig. 7d )."
549,618036,"Recently, extensive analyses of frameshifting by RSV (Jacks et a/., 1988b) , and IBV (Brierley et a/., 1989) , have shown that the secondary or potential tertiary pseudoknot structures just downstream of the frameshift signal sequences are generally required for efficient frameshifting. It has been proposed that these structures probably cause a subset of ribosomes to pause or slow their scanning speed at the frameshift site, thus allowing ribosomes time to recognize the frameshift signal. This then results in frameshifting at the signal sequence. The signal sequence varies from virus to virus. However, for HIV-1 ribosomal frameshifting within the gag-pol overlap region does not appear to involve a downstream pseudoknot in juxtaposition to the signal and although another secondary structure of the mRNA is in juxtaposition, this sequence has been demonstrated to be dispensible. The HIV-1 frameshifting signal involves a sequence of six U residues (Wilson et al., 1988) ."
550,2221550,"The multi-targeted approach is often accomplished with multiplexed amplification of the targeted nucleic acid. Several nucleic acid amplification technologies have been established and have been reviewed elsewhere. [18, 48, 49] For example, am-plification can be performed using a multiplexed version of PCR, and then products or amplicons of this reaction need to be demultiplexed for proper detection and identification of the virus. [50] This demultiplexing can be done by a variety of technologies including, but not limited to, probe-based fluorescent differentiation, [51] capillary and gel electrophoresis, [52] microarray technology, [53] Luminex beads with flow cytometric analysis, [54] or mass spectrophotometry. [55, 56] The following sections highlight each of these approaches, with specific examples that are currently available and useful for investigation of respiratory viral outbreaks. Extensive reviews covering a broader scope of molecular assays that are useful for outbreak-related viral detection and characterization have been published. [57, 58] Use of molecular assays has generated significant information about the epidemiology of respiratory viral outbreaks that was not readily obtained using conventional methods. Co-infections involving two or more viruses were previously not detected often, [59] but are now detected frequently through the use of molecular methods (table I) . [60] [61] [62] Many of these involve viruses that were formerly undetectable or were simply not sought using conventional methods. [63] In addition, many outbreaks can be shown to involve multiple viruses circulating within an institution. [64] In our initial study of 22 institutional outbreaks using a multiplex approach, multiple viruses were detected in eight outbreaks (36%). [65] 3. Probe-Based PCR Assays PCR assays developed for outbreak investigations typically fall into two categories: multi-targeted PCR using consensus or universal primers; and several single-plex PCRs, which are then used in a triaged manner. For example, detection of novel strains of influenza A has been done with universal primers [66] and with more type-specific single-plex PCRs in a reflexed manner. [67] Typically, a combination of universal primers and specific primers is most useful for outbreak investigation. A good example is an influenza A screening approach whereby laboratories start with a broad-spectrum single-plex PCR, based on the highly conserved matrix gene, and follow-up the typing of positively identified influenza A specimens using typespecific PCRs against the hemagglutinin gene. [68, 69] In either case, the combination of primers or the array of single-plex PCRs are designed to provide a process of elimination to hone in on the viral pathogen of interest, thereby identifying the causative outbreak agent."
551,292,"On the other hand, crystallographic evidence for the formation of low-energy trimeric hairpins by divergent virus glycoproteins has been accumulated during the last two decades (Eckert and Kim, 2001; Harrison, 2008; Weissenhorn et al., 1997; White et al., 2008; Yin et al., 2006) . The fact that Class II glycoproteins make use of trimeric hairpins to induce fusion underpins the functional relevance of these structures (Harrison, 2008; Vaney and Rey, 2011) . However, in contrast to the helical domains implied in Class I fusion, the Class II glycoprotein subunits employ articulated ␤barrel domains to assemble membrane-pulling trimeric hairpins (Harrison, 2008; Vaney and Rey, 2011; White et al., 2008) . Yet another class of fusion glycoproteins combine structural features of Class I and Class II fusion proteins, and have been designated as Class III (Backovic and Jardetzky, 2009; Baquero et al., 2013; Weissenhorn et al., 2007; White et al., 2008) . Fusogenic subunits of Class II and Class III proteins possess conserved hydrophobic loops that connect extended strands at the tip of elongated ␤-barrel domains. These ""fusion loops"" (FLs) are thought to insert into the target membrane and function during fusion in a way reminiscent of Class I FPs. Thus, the fact that Class I/II/III glycoproteins make use of similar elements, but different structural scaffolds, highlights the functional convergence underlying cell-virus membrane fusion."
552,1161411,"The epidemic of infectious diseases is a complex spreading process that occurs in population. There is a long history of modeling infectious disease epidemics (Anderson et al., 1992) , and various modeling paradigms have been developed. Kermark & Mckendrick (1927) proposed the classic SIR model, which is a compartmental model. Assuming that every individual is the same, the population is homogeneous mixing. The contact is instant and independent of history, infection rate and recovery rate are constant. All people in the same state form a compartment, and as the state changes, personnel move between the compartments. With the growth of urban population and the development of transportation networks, social mobility has increased, and the spatial expansion of infectious diseases has shown a new pattern. Especially when people move between different regions, the spread of infectious diseases is very common. Understanding the impact of human movement patterns on the prevalence of infectious diseases has attracted considerable attention (Gonzalez et al., 2008) , and a meta-population model derived from ecology has been applied in the field of infectious diseases. With the rise of complexity science, the micro-modeling specification has been developed and combined with social networks, a network-based micro-individual modeling method has been developed, which provides a new way to understand the spread of infectious diseases. These models enable epidemiologists and health authorities to understand the transmission process, predict its impact on healthy populations, and assess the After the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan, most of the research focused on estimating the source, transmission characteristics and the estimation of the scale (Mizumoto et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020; Hébert-Dufresne et al., 2020; Fu et al., 2020; Yeo et al., 2020) . In particular, the basic reproduction ratio has been widely debated as a parameter that reflects the speed of virus transmission. Some literatures analyzed the spread of COVID-19 using population migration data, which are calculated based on the migration outflow from Wuhan (Zhan et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020) , Little attention has been paid to the spread of the nationwide and even global cities caused by population migration. There is also a literature on how to intervene and control the spread of the COVID-19 virus (Qian et al., 2020; Heymann & Shindo, 2020) ; Gao et al., 2020) ."
553,455556,"According to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a person is a super-spreader if they cause more than 10 secondary infections. Such super-spreading individuals have been identified in the SARS outbreak and they are thought to have caused most of the secondary infections. For example, in Singapore, about 80% of infections have been attributed to only 5 superspreading individuals ( [7] ). One extreme super-spreading individual in Hong Kong caused more than 100 secondary infections ( [13] ). To contrast, in Singapore, most individuals caused 0 secondary infections ( [10] ). One differential equation model for super-spreading individuals was proposed before the recent SARS outbreak, by Kemper ([6] ). He presents a modified susceptibleinfected -removed (SIR) disease model to capture the effect of the super-spreading individuals in which the infected individuals are split into two different infected classes with different transmission rates. The superspreaders have a higher transmission rate, meaning more of their contacts with susceptible individuals result in a new infection than the regular infected individuals. This was the first model designed specifically to address the effect of super-spreading individuals on the course of infectious disease epidemics."
554,858752,"The Global Collaboration on Traumatic Stress (GC-TS) started as a committee of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) (Olff, 2014; Schnyder & Olff, 2013) Since 2019 it has grown into an independent body with a steering committee representing all major traumatic stress societies (see www.global-psychotrauma.net). The GC-TS recognizes that across the world, exposure to trauma is the norm rather than the exception (Kessler et al., 2017; Schnyder et al., 2017) ; that the great majority of the global burden of disease arising from mental health conditions occurs in low and middle income countries (Schnyder et al., 2017) ; that traumatic experiences, trauma-related symptoms, as well as treatment approaches differ across cultures, and, finally, that trauma does not stop at borders. It therefore aims 'To identify objectives, facilitate development, and coordinate activities of global importance …. the community of traumatic stress researchers and practitioners should develop collaborations, and ultimately structures, that enable them to optimally respond to those tasks that are best addressed by means of international collaboration' (Schnyder et al., 2017) .

Several researchers stated that thermal image scanning has the potential to enhance screening for infectious diseases [17] [18] [19] . A mass temperature screening solution utilizing AI was developed to reduce the need for manual temperature screening. Integrated Health Information Systems and KroniKare are currently piloting a screening solution that automatically screens and identifies patients with symptoms such as fever [20]. Sun et al.

We strengthened our sexual health laboratory with the capacity to conduct molecular-based Treponema pallidum DNA studies [25] [26] [27] , and created a biospecimen repository of over 3000 serum and clinical specimens. We also conducted evaluations of multiple new commercial point-of-care rapid immunoassays [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , created clinical research infrastructure at two sexual health clinics in Lima to recruit, screen, enroll and reliably assess and retain participants, and conducted epidemiologic and clinical/immunological evaluations including positron emission tomography scanning [33, 34] and novel serum cytokine analyses [35, 36] ."
559,1181878,"FCoVs are further classified into two serotypes that differ in their growth characteristics in cell culture and antigenicity relative to canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) (Pedersen et al., 1984) . Type II FCoVs are the result of recombination between a type I FCoV and CCoV (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . Both types of FCoV can cause FIP (Pedersen et al., 1984) . Type I and II FCoVs have different cell tropisms that can be explained by differences in the binding specificity of their respective spike proteins (Hohdatsu et al., 1998) . Based upon recognized differences in the spike genes of these two virus types, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses has been employed as an alternative method to distinguish between type I and II viruses (Addie et al., 2003; Benetka et al., 2004) . The prevalence of type I and II FCoV has been surveyed in many countries, including the The outcomes of feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection vary greatly from asymptomatic or mild enteric infection to fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). On the basis of in vitro neutralization tests, FCoVs can be divided into two serotypes. To explore the correlation between different types of FCoV and FIP, clinical specimens collected from 363 naturally infected cats during 2003-2007 were analyzed. Amplification of a portion of the S gene from the FCoV was performed and a total of 222 cases were differentiated. Among them, 197 (88.7%) cats were type I-positive, 13 (5.9%) were type II-positive, and 12 (5.4%) were positive for both types. Irrespective of the predominance of type I FCoV infection in Taiwan, type II FCoV demonstrated a significantly higher correlation with FIP (p < 0.01). Analysis of partial S gene sequences of the local type I and II FCoVs strains revealed that type I viruses were more genetically divergent (6.2-11.7%) than type II viruses (0.6-3.2%) within the 5-year study period. The higher genetic diversity of type I FCoVs might be due to the larger infected cat population and to the long period of viral persistence in asymptomatic cats in comparison to type II viruses."
560,968295,"(i) is COVID-19 relevant to psychiatry and is Psychiatry relevant to COVID-19? J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f My instinctive answer is ""of course, it is"" since any international medical crisis should be of relevance to psychiatry because of both the impact of the medical condition itself on people (directly on affected persons and indirectly on their family and friends) as also the effects of society's response (e.g., quarantine, lock-down, etc.) on mental health. As I discuss this opinion with my medical colleagues (including some psychiatrists), their immediate response is in the negative-COVID-19 is a respiratory infection/disease requiring the attention of pulmonologists, intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists, and epidemiologists, not psychiatrists. When I discuss the mental health effects of any epidemic on the general population with specific reference to COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020) , and specific mental health challenges faced by the above healthcare professionals , they promptly change their opinion (some reluctantly!) and acknowledge an important place for Psychiatry."
561,1798835,"Comparative data from international studies do lend support to the theory that cultural values and societal norms impact upon quarantine compliance rates. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed residents of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and the U.S. and found significant regional variability [22] . The proportion of survey respondents favouring the quarantine of persons suspected of having been exposed to a serious contagious disease was as follows: 76% in the U.S., 81% in Hong Kong, 89% in Singapore, and 95% in Taiwan. By way of comparison, in the present study, 94% of respondents agreed that quarantine is a good way to stop the spread of infectious disease outbreaks. Interestingly, in our study, significantly fewer (58%) agreed that public health officials should be able to detain those who fail to obey quarantine orders. Likewise, in the Harvard study, the proportions favouring the use of quarantine decrease significantly if people could be arrested for refusing (to a low of only 42% in the U.S. to a high of 70% in Taiwan). The authors partially attributed the observed differences to prior experience with infectious disease outbreaks in which quarantine and other restrictive measures were implemented [21] ."
562,2418309,"Previous studies have indicated that in addition to ACE2, other coreceptors or cellular molecules are required for SARS-CoV infection [7] . Our results suggest that the efficient entry of SARS-CoV into host cells requires the involvement of HSPGs in concert with ACE2. Increased infectivity of SARS pseudovirus was associated with binding to HS. Elimination of cell-surface HS by heparinase or the addition of exogenous heparin reduced the ability of the virus to bind to the cell surface and increased cellular resistance to infection. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that murine coronavirus utilizes HSPGs as a receptor for cell entry [52] , suggesting that HSPGs may also play an important role in (A) Interference of the interaction between Vero E6 and SARS pseudovirus by LF, heparin and heparinase leads to reduction of viral infection. Vero E6 cells were treated by the same methods above with 10 mM LF, 10 mM heparin or 10 U of heparinase I, respectively. Then, the cells were incubated with SARS pseudovirus as described in Methods. GFP-expressing cells in the total population were analyzed by flow cytometry. The relative viral infection ratio was measured by comparing the percentage of GFP expressing cells of each group to that of the control. Error bars represent the SD of three independent experiments. *** P,0.001 and **P,0.01. (B) Incubation with LF or heparin, or degradation of HSPGs by heparinase inhibits SARS pseudovirus infection of Caco-2 cells.

Thus, it is very likely that HSPGs serve as SARS-CoV attachment sites and facilitate the concentration of the virus on the cell surface as well as access to specific entry receptors. At the preliminary stage, the docking of the virus to host cells is mediated by the interaction between the spike protein and HS chains of HSPGs. This association facilitates the further binding of SARS-CoV to its cell-surface receptor, ACE2. The current widely accepted model for the role of HSPGs suggests that the transport of extracellular virus particles from the low affinity anchoring sites to the high affinity specific entry receptors is a ubiquitous phenomenon in viral invasion, which is termed 'viral surfing' [48] . Through the weak and reversible interaction between the virus and the docking sites, the virus binds to host cells and scans the cell surface for the specific receptors. SARS-CoV may also adopt a similar strategy for cell entry. Figure 9 illustrates the hypothetical process of SARS-CoV infection. However, SARS-CoV attachment to HSPGs alone does not enable viral entry. HSPGs are widely distributed on the surface of mammalian cells. However, the target cells of SARS-CoV are limited to lung alveolar epithelial cells, enterocytes of the small intestine and the brush border of the proximal tubular cells of the kidney, among others [3] . Therefore, HSPGs play an important and complex role in promoting SARS-CoV infection. The entry process also requires the interaction of viral spike protein with one or more co-receptor molecules, such as ACE2, on the cell surface."

Furthermore, some biologically active substituted quinazolin-4(3H)-ones were isolated from various fungi and bacteria species. For example, 2-(4-hydroxybenzyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one (1) was found in an entomopathogenic fungus Isaria farinosa and its strong inhibitory properties on the replication of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [30] were recognised, whereas its 2-(4-hydroxybenzoyl) analogue 2 present in fungus from Penicillium genus appeared only slightly active toward TMV [30] . Moreover, compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxicity toward various cancer cell lines [31, 32] . Quinazolinone 3 isolated from Streptomyces sp. appeared cytotoxic against Vero cells [33] . Very recently synthetic pyridine-containing analogue 4 and its 3-substituted derivatives 5 and 6 have been obtained and their slight activity against influenza A virus was revealed [34] .

565,1984716,"Sequencing of viral genomes during outbreaks provides much needed information in terms of viral adaptation [4] and informs molecular epidemiological studies [11] . Due to recombination in coronaviruses (e.g. [12, 13] ) current diagnostics may not remain fit for purpose and therefore metagenomic approaches provide independent verification of the presence of viral genomes as well information on the underlying microbiome -which may contribute to severe disease in COVID-19. One limitation of the metagenomic approach is the limit of detection and in this study, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced using the SISPA approach. For diagnostic purposes, RT-qPCR generally is more sensitive, provided that the primer binding sites remain conserved in the pathogen being tested. In this case, RT-qPCR diagnostic reagents can be revaluated based upon using sequencing as sentinel for these events."
566,414024,"In this study, we successfully quantified ambient influenza virus using filtration/real-time qPCR. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing concentrations of influenza virus in ambient air. In previous studies, airborne infectious viruses have been detected using filtration coupled with a PCR-based method in indoor environments with high virus concentrations (e.g., hospitals and offices), including varicella-zoster virus, human cytomegalovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, acute respiratory syndrome corona virus, and rhinovirus (Aintablian et al. 1998; McCluskey et al. 1996; Myatt et al. 2004; Sawyer et al. 1994; Tsai et al. 2006) . In those studies, airborne viruses were only qualitatively or semiquantitatively detected, involving only positive or negative responses in a narrow dynamic range (< 4 orders of magnitude), and no concentration profiles were reported. Airborne influenza viruses were successfully quantified in hospitals and wet poultry markets in two recent studies (Blachere et al. 2009; Chen et al. 2009 ). Because the use of a high-volume sampler would increase the total amount of virus collected in a given sample, enhancing detection sensitivity, we compared the performance of a high-volume sampler with that of a PTFE cassette. Our results (Table 2) show that virus concentrations detected using the PTFE cassette were all higher than those detected using the highvolume sampler. Regarding sampling stress, the face velocity of the high-volume sampler (0.003 m/sec) is actually lower than that of the PTFE cassette (0.3 m/sec). We also observed the same trend in our previous study, where we obtained higher virus concentrations with a PTFE cassette than when with an open-face filter cassette with lower face velocity. Higher concentrations of various inhibitors such as airborne bacteria cosampled in the filters of a high-volume sampler might contribute to the lower sensitivity of this method. The inhibitory rates observed here were also consistent with this hypothesis (Table 2 ). According to our data, a PTFE cassette is superior for sampling ambient influenza virus."

568,2361056,"Generally, EIAs, OIAs and ICLFs require approximately 10 5 −10 6 viral particles to obtain a positive result. This is in contrast to cell culture and molecular amplification assays that may only require as few as 10 virus particles, or 2−5 RNA or DNA targets, respectively, for virus detection (St. George et al., 2002) . Numerous studies have demonstrated that the sensitivities of the assays vary significantly and range from 44% to 95% for influenza and 59% to 89% for RSV, as compared to cell culture (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007) . Results vary due to study design, properties of the assay, patient population and comparator test method and caution should be used in the interpretation and comparison of study results. The sensitivity of non-IF RSV antigen tests is higher than that of non-IF antigen tests for influenza A and B and is generally higher than that of cell culture due to the lability of RSV. During the respiratory season, assay specificity for RSV and influenza non-IF antigen tests is high, 93-100% and 74-100%, respectively (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007; WHO, 2005) .

RNA was isolated from affected tissues of these FIP-affected cats, as well as from feces of a healthy littermate (cat 6-49). The tissue-and feces-derived viral RNAs were partially sequenced and the sequences of pairs FECV 6-49/FIPV 6-51 and FECV 6-49/FIPV 6-53 were compared. The genetic homology between this FECV and the FIPVs was 98.7 and 97.3% and was significantly higher than that between unrelated feline coronaviruses ( Table 2 ). The 7b ORFs were intact and colinear in all of three strains. However, there were specific mutations in the 3c ORFs of the FIPVs but not in the FECV (Fig. 5) . Deletions were present in the 3c ORFs of FIPV 6-51 and 6-53. Both deletions resulted in a shift to a different reading frame like those of other FIPV strains (see above). Remarkably, the deletions in FIPV 6-51 and 6-53 were distinct, demonstrating that these two FIPVs were independently derived from FECV and not spread horizontally. These FIPVs, from two diseased siblings, were both related to a fecal isolate from a healthy littermate (cat 6-49)."
571,1964936,"As evidenced by previous epidemics caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics for COVID-19 are essential for case identification, contact tracing, animal source finding, and rationalization of infection control measures (14) (15) (16) . The use of viral culture for establishing acute diagnosis is not practical, as it takes at least 3 days for SARS-CoV-2 to cause obvious cytopathic effects in selected cell lines, such as VeroE6 cells (3) . Moreover, isolation of the virus requires biosafety level 3 facilities, which are not available in most health care institutions. Serum antibody and antigen detection tests have not yet been validated, and there may be cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV, which shares a high degree (ϳ82%) of nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2 (17) . Because of these limitations, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) remains the most useful laboratory diagnostic test for COVID-19 worldwide."

573,1769543,"The present study is original and unique in two methodologic aspects. The fi rst is the inclusion of two sampling methods that was used. The proportion in the present study is signifi cantly lower than the outlying proportion of 56% that was reported in the fi fth study 5 but has not been confi rmed in other studies. The frequency distribution of specifi c viruses is substantially different among these fi ve studies. A grouping of the proportions of the principal viruses identifi ed in these studies yields the following ranges: 4% to 12% for infl uenza viruses, 1% to 17% for rhinovirus, 2% to 13% for coronaviruses, 1% to 4% for RSV, 0% to 4% for human metapneumovirus, 0% to 4% for adenovirus, and 1% to 7% for parainfl uenza viruses. The corresponding proportions from our study are within these ranges, except for RSV for which our proportion was higher than in previous studies. which was signifi cantly higher than among patients with CAP, could be attributed mainly to infl uenza viruses that were identifi ed in 31.3% of patients with NPLRTI. On this issue, it is noteworthy that our study population included patients with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in whom we looked for viral etiologies. Thus, a patient with a clinical picture of LRTI diagnosed as infl uenza virus based on polymerase chain reaction fi ndings was considered by us to be a patient with LRTI with an infl uenza etiology."
574,2838413,"A current theory of addiction relates psychomotor stimulation and the process of positive reinforcement through homology, i.e., a derivation from common neurobiological mechanisms. Within this theoretical consideration, psychomotor stimulant behavior, i.e., approach behavior or locomotor behavior is a predictor and a measure of reinforcement (32) . Within this context, cocaine is known as a distinctive psychomotor stimulant. Moreover, compelling evidence through various reinforcement paradigms shows that cocaine exerts its potent reinforcing properties through a dopaminergic molecular component, particularly in mesolimbic neuronal circuitry, and particularly at the dopamine transporter (6, 26, 27, 31) . In tandem, the hyperactive locomotor activity produced by psychomotor stimulants has been shown to be highly correlated with increased DA levels in nucleus accumbens, postmortem (18) . Thus the first purpose of this paper was to study a possible underlying commonality between a reinforcing dopaminergic mechanism and a reinforcing behavioral mechanism of cocaine, simultaneously, in vivo, on line, instantaneously and in real time, to further elucidate what appears to be the satisfying or compensating events of cocaine."

Among the identified recombinants, the HRV-A36/A67 recombinant clusters with previously documented similar recombinants (GenBank entries: EU840918.1, EU840872.1, EU840750.1, EU840930.1, EU840884.1 and EU840762.1) identified in Switzerland and indicates a worldwide circulation [42] . Interestingly, another HRV-A67 recombinant (HRV-A12/A67) was identified with the same recombination breakpoint on HRV-A67. Thus, HRV-A67 5'UTR may represent a recombination hotspot. Moreover, parental strains, such as CV-A8, CV-A10, HRV-A12 and HRV-A67, were identified in our cohort, thus confirming co-circulation with CV-A10/CV-A8, HRV-A12/HRV-A67 and HRV-A36/HRV-A67 recombinants. This indicates that recombinant strains did not outcompete parental strains among circulating viruses. We achieved 5'UTR sequences of many HRV-C types, as well as the VP3 sequence of HRV-C23, which allowed to complete the databases currently available for these viruses [9] . This may help to identify potential HRV-C 5'UTR recombinants in future epidemiology studies."
576,134587,"Bronchial hyperreactivity is usually thought of as an abnormality of the lower respiratory tract. Recently it has been described in two disorders in which the lower respiratory tract is usually normal. Patients with allergic rhinitis, who are at risk for asthma subsequently, frequently exhibit increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness; and acute viral upper respiratory tract infections may induce bronchial responsiveness. This de novo induction of hyperresponsiveness during airway infection suggests a mechanism that may explain the frequent associations of upper respiratory tract infections with wheezing episodes in patients with asthma and also why some healthy persons can develop persisting bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The mechanism underlying hyperresponsive airways is not known, but it has been suggested that abnormalities may exist in mucosal permeability, in autonomic control of bronchial smooth muscle, or in the smooth muscle itself.' Most hypotheses presume an abnormality in the lower respiratory tract, and so offer explanation for abnormal responses seen in diseases apparently limited to the upper respiratory tract. The access of molecules from the lumen of the respiratory tract to submucosal structures is limited in the normal state by the maintenance of ""tight junctions"" between epithelial cells. These junctions may be disrupted after exposure to pollutants2 or to IgEmediated inflammation.3 However, abnormal bronchoconstriction also occurs when histamine is given parenterally to patients with asthma,4 so this cannot be the sole mechanism. The caliber of the lower airways is under balanced autonomic control. Vagal efferent nerves decrease airway caliber, and the afferent input to these reflexes may originate in irritant receptors in either the lower or upper tract mucosa.5 A major balancing factor is sympathetic tone, and decreased beta adrenergic responsiveness has been shown in asthma,h chronic bronchitis,' and viral upper respiratory tract infections8 Abnormalities of the bronchial smooth muscle, either hypertrophy or increased mass or abnormal response characteristics, have been proposed as mechanisms for hyperractivity.'"
577,921610,"Infection with SARS-CoV causes lower respiratory tract disease with clinical symptoms that include fever, malaise, and lymphopenia [1] . Approximately 20%-30% of SARS patients require management in intensive care units, and the overall fatality rate has approached 10%. Interestingly, children seem to be relatively resistant to SARS, but the reason for this restriction is not known [2] [3] [4] . The clinical course of SARS follows three phases [5, 6] . In the first phase, there is active viral replication and patients experience systemic symptoms. In the second phase, virus levels start to decrease while antibodies, which are effective in controlling infection, increase. However, pneumonia and immunopathological injury also develop in this phase. Ultimately, in the third phase, fatal cases of SARS progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), characterized by the presence of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [1, 7] . It has been hypothesized that the pathological changes are caused by a disproportional immune response, illustrated by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as CXCL10 (IP-10), CCL2 (MCP-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-1b, and interferon (IFN)-c [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .

Moreover, both throat swab and stool tests turned negative in Case 1 before discharge. During home isolation, none of the two cases experienced discomfort, indicating that disease relapse was unlikely."
579,855891,"Active interruption of unproductive folding attempts and generation of an ERAD signal: mechanisms conservation and possible divergences between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other Eukarya Even for correct gene products, a fraction ranging from 30% [14] to much less [15] never attains the native structure. Folding-defective polypeptides are cleared from the ER lumen and most of them are degraded by cytosolic proteasomes. The series of events leading to disposal of terminally misfolded glyco-polypeptides from the ER lumen have initially been characterized in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae [16, 17] . The yeast ERManI first removes the mannose residue i (Figure 1 ) from protein-bound oligosaccharides. This is not sufficient to tag polypeptides for disposal because it also occurs for native polypeptides that will be selected for secretion ( Figure 2 , step 2) [18] . However, it is a pre-requisite for the intervention of yeast EDEM, which removes the mannose residue k (Figure 1 ) from oligosaccharides dis-played on misfolded conformers [19,20 ,21 ] . This cleavage generates a signal that recruits Yos9p, an ERAD lectin containing a mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain that binds Man 7 oligosaccharides exposing the terminal a1,6-bonded mannose j [20 ,21 ,22] . Yos9p releases misfolded polypeptides with luminal or transmembrane folding defects (ERAD-L and ERAD-M substrates) to retro-translocation complexes built around the membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p. Misfolded polypeptides with cytosolic folding defects (ERAD-C substrates) engage retro-translocation complexes containing the E3 ubiquitin ligase Doa10p. These complexes facilitate transport of misfolded polypeptides across the ER membrane and their proteasomal degradation [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] ."

For example, Mesalazine, an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease, is a top network-predicted repurposable drug associated with HCoVs (Fig. 5a ). Yet, several clinical studies showed the potential pulmonary toxicities (including pneumonia) associated with mesalazine usage 81, 82 . Integration of lung-specific gene expression 23 of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 host proteins and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling 83 may reduce side effects of repurposable drugs or drug combinations. Preclinical studies are warranted to evaluate in vivo efficiency and side effects before clinical trials. Furthermore, we only limited to predict pairwise drug combinations based on our previous network-based framework 28 . However, we expect that our methodology remain to be a useful network-based tool for prediction of combining multiple drugs toward exploring network relationships of multiple drugs' targets with the HCoV-host subnetwork in the human interactome. Finally, we aimed to systematically identify repurposable drugs by specifically targeting nCoV host proteins only. Thus, our current network models cannot predict repurposable drugs from the existing anti-virus drugs that target virus proteins only. Thus, combination of the existing anti-virus drugs (such as remdesivir 64 ) with the network-predicted repurposable drugs (Fig. 5 ) or drug combinations (Fig. 6 ) may improve coverage of current network-based methodologies by utilizing multi-layer network framework 16 ."

This may suggest that detection of HBoV1-DNA in blood represents a true viraemia, but this singular finding should be studied on a larger scale. Nevertheless, as it has been shown before, 9, 12 HBoV1-viraemia was strongly associated with RTI in general and, although weaker, with LRTI. It is most likely that a viraemia with HBoV1 indicates a present HBoV1-infection."
582,3146250,"Paramyxoviruses enter cells by fusion of their lipid envelope with the target cell plasma membrane. Fusion of the viral membrane with the plasma membrane allows entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. For paramyxoviruses, membrane fusion occurs at neutral pH, but the trigger mechanism that controls the viral entry machinery such that it occurs at the right time and in the right place remains to be elucidated. Two viral glycoproteins are key to the infection process-an attachment protein that varies among different paramyxoviruses and the fusion (F) protein, which is found in all paramyxoviruses. For many of the paramyxoviruses (parainfluenza viruses 1 -5, mumps virus, Newcastle disease virus and others), the attachment protein is the hemagglutinin/neuraminidase (HN) protein. In the last 5 years, atomic structures of paramyxovirus F and HN proteins have been reported. The knowledge gained from these structures towards understanding the mechanism of viral membrane fusion is described. D"

In the field, pigs frequently become infected with PRCV around the age of 5 to 6 weeks in the presence of declining maternal antibody titres. It remains to be determined if these pigs also show a decreased duration of virus excretion following TGEV challenge."
584,3044441,"Background. With the increased occurrence of outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide there is concern that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings. We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. Conclusions/Significance. Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time. It therefore can be a useful tool to inform policy decisions."

There is no clear image of the spectrum of symptoms or severity of COVID-19. Common symptoms include fever, cough, weakness, and dyspnea. The less frequent symptoms include anorexia, diarrhea, pharyngalgia, abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, low level of consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease, ataxia, neuralgia, fatigue, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sore throat, arthralgia, asthenia, rhinorrhea, sneezing, myalgia, vomiting, orbital pain, facial pain and fullness, nasal irritation, otalgia, cephalalgia, delirium, hoarse voice, hypogeusia, hyposmia, unilateral facial palsy, vertigo, and skin rash [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . After assessing the exclusion criteria in 500 patients with COVID-19 (i.e., patients who were dead, lost to follow-up, or admitted to the intensive care unit), we recruited 100 patients with COVID-19, based on the laboratoryconfirmed (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who had fever, dyspnea, non-productive cough, weakness, and myalgia at the time of admission. The subjects were admitted to Shahid Modarres Hospital in Saveh, Iran, between March 1, 2020 and April 1, 2020.

586,3051922,"As the current COVID-19 outbreak shows, disease epidemic is a complex problem which must be tackled with the right public policy. One of the main tools of the policymakers is to control the contact rate among the population, commonly referred to as social distancing, in order to reduce the spread of the disease. We pose a mean-field game model of individuals each choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of utility from contacts but also risk of infection from those contacts. We compute and compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes individuals acting selfishly to maximize their own utility, to the socially optimal strategy, which is the strategy maximizing the total utility of the population. We prove that the infected always want to make more contacts than the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the need to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining, sick paid leave). Additionally, we compute the socially optimal strategies, given the costs to incentivize people to change from their selfish strategies. We find that if we impose limited resources, curbing contacts of the infected is more important after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the price of anarchy of this system, to understand the conditions under which large discrepancies between the MFE and socially optimal strategies arise, which is when public policy would be most effective. arXiv:2005.06758v1 [q-bio.PE]"

To date, no drugs or vaccines have been employed to improve clinical outcomes for RSV-infected patients. In this paper, we report that angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protected against severe lung injury induced by RSV infection in an experimental mouse model and in pediatric patients. Moreover, ACE2 deficiency aggravated RSV-associated disease pathogenesis, mainly by its action on the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R). Furthermore, administration of a recombinant ACE2 protein alleviated the severity of RSV-induced lung injury. These findings demonstrate that ACE2 plays a critical role in preventing RSV-induced lung injury, and suggest that ACE2 is a promising potential therapeutic target in the management of RSV-induced lung disease."

In contrast to the wide distribution of ACE, ACE2 expression was initially thought to be restricted to endothelial and VSMCs of the heart and kidney (Donoghue et al., 2000; Tipnis et al., 2000; Crackower et al., 2002) although a more widespread distribution is emerging (see Hamming et al., 2007) . Unlike the dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase ACE, ACE2 cleaves a single amino acid from the C-termimal of the peptide substrate. Thus, ACE2 cleaves Ang I to the inactive Ang (1-9), which may then be converted to the vasodilator peptide, Ang (1-7), by ACE. More importantly, ACE2 may also directly metabolise Ang II to form Ang (1-7), and this reaction occurs at a faster rate than the formation of Ang (1-9) from Ang I (Carey & Siragy, 2003; Rice et al., 2004) . Thus, ACE2 may counter-regulate ACE activity by simultaneously decreasing Ang II levels and increasing Ang (1-7) formation (Hamming et al., 2007) .

Anti-CHIKV Phosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomer (CPMO) was evaluated for its antiviral efficacy and cytotoxcity in human cells and neonate murine model. Two CPMOs were designed to block translation initiation of a highly conserved sequence in CHIKV non-structural and structural polyprotein, respectively. Pre-treatment of HeLa cells with CPMO1 signficantly suppressed CHIKV titre, CHIKV E2 protein expression and prevented CHIKV-induced CPE. CPMO1 activity was also CHIKV-specific as shown by the lack of cross-reactivity against SINV or DENV replication. When administered prophylactically in neonate mice, 15 μg/g CPMO1v conferred 100% survival against CHIKV disease. In parallel, these mice demonstrated significant reduction in viremia and viral load in various tissues. Immunohistological examination of skeletal muscles and liver of CPMO1vtreated mice also showed healthy tissue morphology, in contrast to evident manifestation of CHIKV pathogenesis in PBS-or scrambled sCPMO1v-treated groups. Taken together, our findings highlight for the first time that CPMO1v has strong protective effect against CHIKV infection. This warrants future development of morpholino as an alternative antiviral agent to address CHIKV infection in clinical applications."

601,1628588,"The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic highlighted the essential role of hospital care of the severely ill in the response to public health emergencies. Early reports from Mexico and Canada of intensive care units (ICUs) filled to capacity with patients with severe respiratory infections helped to calibrate the early, aggressive global public health response. [1] [2] [3] The critical care medical community and public health reacted with unprecedented coordination to describe severe disease, to disseminate data on the epidemiology and care of pandemic patients, and to convey the impact of the outbreak on health systems.

This problem is particularly acute in resource-limited settings where there is decreased capacity to manage severe illness. While building resource-intensive and highly technological ICUs is not feasible for many parts of the world, much can be done to improve care for severely ill patients in more austere environments. In this review, we discuss the inter-related issues of pandemic influenza, severe seasonal influenza, and severe illness more generally.

602,952874,"Diabetes can impair the innate immune system 75 and render individuals more susceptible to a range of infectious diseases and severe illnesses. 13, 75, 76 For example, during seasonal influenza outbreaks, compared to healthy subjects, diabetic patients were shown to have 6fold higher risk of becoming critically ill and acquire hospitalization with 4-fold increased rates of pneumonia-related hospitalizations and a 3-fold elevated likelihood of dying of complications. 77 Diabetes share several common features with infectious disorders and its complication such as the endothelial dysfunction, the pro-inflammatory state and the attenuation of innate immune response. 75 The cytokine overload related to the Th1 (microbicidal action of IFN-) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory IL-4, -5, -10 and -13) shift in severe viral infection when accompanied by the increased cytokine levels arising from diabetes, both can be detrimental to the endothelium and lead to a range of subsequent complications. 78 Dampened innate immunity and the shift from Th1 to Th2 responses were implicated in linking the high prevalence of allergy observed in fatal viral infections, e.g., Dengue fever. 79 Furthermore, diabetes can impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response 76 where individuals become at increased risk of severe infectious disease outcome. In support, diabetes-associated hyperglycemia and cellular insulinopenia are known to impair macrophage and lymphocyte functions with a subsequent status of reduced immune response. 76 Furthermore, levels of HbA1c ≥9% were linked to a 60% increased risk of pneumonia-related complications and hospitalization due to a lower immune response. 80 Host defense to infection is largely mediated by cellular immunity and the synthesis of related cytokines, such as IFN-and interleukins, is downregulated in diabetes. 75 , 81 The present study has several limitations. Inspection of the funnel plot ( Figure 2 ) and the Egger's test indicates that publication bias may have been derived from the small-study effect, i.e., the possibility of including small studies with spuriously overstated estimates while ignoring those without statistically significant effects that may have a lower possibility of being published. Furthermore, the identified reports have shown 8-fold among-studies variance in the diabetes proportion for H1N1 (0.04-0.35; Figure 3 ) and MERS-CoV (0.1-0.8, Figure  4 ) cases. These inter-study differences may have contributed to the significant heterogeneity observed in our report. Additional sources of heterogeneity may relate to the large variation among studies in the sample size (19 to 70,000 H1N1 cases and 5 to 161 MERS-CoV patients) or the ethnic diversity of the study populations particularly within the H1N1 studies (collected from 14 counties). Furthermore, heterogeneous methodologies due to different study designs may have influenced the inter-study variation. This observation may levy some limitations on the estimated contribution of diabetes to severe H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases and render our results as a guide to generate more accurate estimates for national or international intervention strategies for severe SARI conditions in diabetic subjects. Furthermore, although the prevalence of diabetes is 15% in severe H1N1 cases and 54% in MERS-CoV, it may not implicate causality and warrants further studies to identify the nature and extent of the coexistence between diabetes and each of the two respiratory infections. Another limitation is the low number of MERS-CoV cases and the narrow geographic region from which it was recruited, compared to the H1N1 cases that rendered subgroup analysis (by region) unattainable for MERS-CoV cases. This particular limitation may add more weight to the suggestion stipulating that the difference in diabetes prevalence between H1N1 and MERS-CoV can be attributable to the regional difference in spread. The small number of MERS-CoV studies highlights the need to develop international collaborations that include cases from countries other than those in the Arabian Peninsula, e.g., from Korea where a few recent cases have been emerged recently. A single study 44 has examined MERS-CoV cases pooled from various countries but the findings were still limited by the small population size. The reports identified in the present study did not distinguish between the prevalence of type 1 and/or type 2 diabetes in H1N1 or MERS-CoV cases. With the exception of three studies (only in the H1N1 -but not MERS-CoV), 14, 17, 35 all the identified reports have combined both types of diabetes despite their different characteristics, etiological factors and clinical features. Cortes Garcia et al., 14 and Koegelenberg et al., 35 have clearly stated that the diabetic cases in their H1N1 series as type 2 cases. Jimenez-Garcia et al., 17 on the other hand, compared the demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions and in-hospital case fatality risk (CFR) in the type 1 (prevalence 0.8%) and type 2 (prevalence 8.4%) diabetic patients and reported a ~2-fold higher CFR in type 2 cases than type 1. 17 Given this paucity of information, it was challenging to distinguish between the two types of diabetes for their role in viral disease severity and complication."

The structure of protein S gives the virus its distinctive crown of spikes and is responsible for binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which allows the virus to enter the host cell 9,10 . ACE2 receptors are present in a range of human cell types, with particular abundance in respiratory and gastrointestinal epithelial cells. In fact, an analysis of ACE2 receptor distribution in human tissues found the highest levels of expression in the small intestine 11 . Although respiratory symptoms are the most frequently described in patients with , several studies have shown that the gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by SARS-CoV-2. A meta-analysis found that 15% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms and that around 10% of patients presented gastrointestinal symptoms but not respiratory symptoms 12 . Conversely, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in the faeces of people without gastrointestinal symptoms [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . A systematic literature review found that more than half (53.9%) of those tested for faecal viral RNA were positive, and noted that the virus is excreted in the stool for long periods, in some cases a month or more after the individual has tested negative for their respiratory samples 15, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . The fact that the virus can grow in enterocytes of human small intestine organelles 25,26 and the discovery of infectious virus in faeces highlights the potential for replication in the gastrointestinal epithelium of patients. However, despite several studies suggesting that transmission of the virus could take place through the faecal-oral axis 27,28 , there is so far insufficient evidence to confirm this method of contagion 19, 29 . Similarly, there has been no evidence of contagion through wastewater, which might reflect SARS-CoV-2's instability in water and its sensitivity to disinfectants 9,29-34 . Viral RNA can, nonetheless, be found in wastewater 33 , which has made monitoring of viral RNA load in sewage a promising tool for the epidemiological tracking of the pandemic [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] ."
604,2239677,"Using discrete time data on an ongoing SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, Donnelly et al. (2003) estimated the mean and variance of the incubation time, time from admission to discharge and time from admission to death. These parameters were obtained using maximum likelihood estimation methods assuming a gamma distribution for each period with allowance for censoring due to incomplete observation. The estimate of the mean and variance of the incubation period was 6.37 days and 16.69 days, respectively. The estimated mean and variance of the admission-to-death time was 35.9 days and 572.9 days, respectively, and the estimated mean and variance of the time from admission to discharge was 23.5 days and 62.1 days, respectively. As pointed out by Leung et al. (2004) , parameters above suffer from right censoring since they were obtained using data from an ongoing epidemic. To address the problem of censoring above, the authors re-estimated parameters above using complete data on all the 1755 cases. The data was completed by using laboratory verification tests on 83.6% of the cases. They estimated the mean incubation period to be 4.6(3.99) days (standard errors in brackets). They also estimated that the time from onset to recovery, and the time from onset to death each followed a gamma distribution with mean 26.5(14.0) and 23.7(14.9) days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). Using parameters estimated by Donnelly et al. (2003) and weekly data on an ongoing SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, Riley et al. (2003) estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) from a discretized stochastic meta-population SEIR model as 2.7 with a 95% confidence interval of (2.2,3.7). It is evident that estimates obtained by Leung et al. (2004) are different from those obtained Donnelly et al. (2003) and as such the estimate of 2.7 above may be biased as it was obtained using estimates obtained with right censored data. It is imperative that a better estimate of the basic reproduction number would be obtained by using estimates obtained by Leung et al. (2004) are different from those obtained Donnelly et al. (2003) and as such the estimate of 2.7 above may be biased as it was obtained using estimates obtained with right censored data. It is imperative that a better estimate of the basic reproduction number would be obtained by using estimates obtained by Leung et al. (2004) . By studying the exponential growth at the beginning of the epidemic and by estimating the generation time, Lipsitch estimated R 0 to be between 2.2 and 3.6. Using a likelihood-based approach on an ongoing epidemic, Wallinga and Tenius (2004) estimated R 0 to be between 2.2 and 3.7. McBryde et al. (2006) applied Bayesian inference techniques to estimate the basic reproduction number and other epidemiological determinants from data arising from a SARS epidemic in Shanzi province of China. They estimated R 0 to be 4.8 with a 95% credible interval of (2.2, 8.8)."
605,1464059,"In these studies, a biased nucleotide composition was found for SARS-CoV-2 genome (Fig. 3) . This bias can also have a major influence on derived parameters, as previously demonstrated for other CoVs (Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015) . This is in agreement with the results of this work, since the nucleotide composition of SARS-CoV-2 has a strong influence in the codons that are used by this virus for the translation of its RNA genome. Previous studies on codon usage in RNA viruses have shown that mutational pressure is the major factor in shaping codon usage patterns in comparison with natural selection (Jenkins and Holmes, 2003; Wang et al., 2011) . Although mutational pressure is still a major driving force, it is certainly not the only evolutionary force that might be considered in RNA viruses. In these studies, a significant A genomic content was found in SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other human CoVs (Fig. 3) . Previous studies done in Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) found that this virus has an A-rich genome and this property has been proposed to help the virus to avoid recognition by the innate immune system (Vabret et al.,2012) . This could provide a strong selective pressure on retroviruses as well as many others RNA viruses, including CoVs (Kindler and Thiel, 2014; van Hemert et al., 2014) . Moreover, previous studies done in HIV suggest that an RNA genome with A-rich domains may provide a molecular signature that is recognized during virus replication (van Hemert et al., 2013) . In the context of CoV, A-rich regions, like the Transcription Regulation Sequence (TRS), which is involved in transcription of sub-genomics RNAs have been established (Pyrc et al., 2004) . This suggest that nucleotide bias may serve distinct biological function in SARS-CoV-2 as J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f well as in other CoVs and is in direct relation to the characteristic codon usage of these viruses (Berkhout and Van Hemert, 2015) ."

Starting material for cDNA cloning was approximately 6 pg of rate-zonally purified genomic RNA obtained from 400 ml of tissue culture medium. An estimated 200 ng of cls cDNA was obtained, as determined by radiolabel incorporation during second strand synthesis, and from this approximately 2000 white colonies were obtained. By colony screening 200 colonies gave a strong signal to 32P-labelecl cDNA prepared from genomic RNA, and of these, 13 had inserts of 200 to 2000 bases as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis of supercoiled plasmids, and were further analyzed by restriction enzyme analysis and poly (A) content. The largest clone of 2000 bases, FG5, did not react by Southern blotting to 32P-labeled oligo(dT), but did cross-hybridize in Southern blot analysis with several other smaller clones that did react strongly with oligo(dT). One of these, 521, a clone of 700 bases, was sequenced in part to determine the primary structure of the extreme 3' end of the genome."
607,1984817,"The CPE reduction assay is a widely-employed assay format to screen for antiviral agents, and it can be scaled for high-throughput screening (35, 36) . In this assay, host cell death is a it consequence of the viral infection and cell viability is a surrogate readout for viral infection that can be measured with a range of cell viability assays. All compounds were tested in doseresponse, and 'hit' antiviral compounds are those that protect the host cells from viral CPE. To increase infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the CPE assay, we used a clone of Vero-E6 that had previously been selected for high ACE2 expression (35) . The cell viability measurements were normalized to cells not infected with the virus (100% activity) and untreated cells infected with virus (0% activity; virus completely kills cells). As a counter-assay, all compounds were tested against cells not exposed to virus, in order to identify compounds that exerted cytotoxicity against Vero E6 cells."
608,702421,"In addition, as an entirely new disease, nothing was known about it, so preventative measures were taken in accordance with the precautionary principle. The WHO issued recommendations to reduce the risk of transfusion transmission, as did the FDA. These measures included deferral of donors with a history of the disease or contact with a patient and those with a history of travel from an affected area. Even relatively casual travel exposure (such as travel through the airport in Toronto) led to temporary deferral, at least in the USA. Subsequent to the development of these precautions, it became apparent that there could be viraemia during symptomatic disease, but it is still unknown whether there is a presymptomatic viraemia. Additionally, epidemiologic studies showed that there were asymptomatic infections, as judged by the prevalence of antibodies to the SARS coronavirus [11] . Again, however, it is unknown whether such asymptomatic infection is accompanied by viraemia. There were no recorded cases of transfusiontransmission of SARS during the outbreak, although it is unclear whether they would actually have been recognized if they did occur."
609,2039556,"Infection with coronavirus is determined by the interaction between the receptor binding domain of its spike (S) protein and corresponding receptors on target cells. S protein is the main determinant of cell tropism and of the induction of neutralizing antibodies [3] . FCoVs can be divided into two serotypes, types I and II, which differ in the neutralizing antibody reaction and have distinct S protein sequences [4] . These two types of FCoV differ in growth characteristics in vitro. Type II FCoV is antigenically related to CCoV and TGEV [5] . The receptor usage of the two types of FCoV is different [6] . Feline aminopeptidase N was identified as a receptor for type II FCoV, but not for type I FCoV [7] . The main receptor for type I FCoV infection remains unclear. A feline dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-grabbing nonintegrin serves as a coreceptor for both type I and II FCoV [8] . Both types of FCoV can infect domestic and wild Felidae and cause FIP [2] . Seroprevalence studies for the detection of the two types of FCoV infection have been performed using various methods, and type I FCoV was found to be predominant in the field, with a seropositive rate of 83-98%, whereas the type II virus accounted for only less than 10% of infections [9] [10] [11] ."

Over 90% of patients received antibiotic therapy, while only 26.5% used corticosteroid. Up to 94.1% patients received antiviral therapy other than lopinavir/ritonavir. Of these, 9 patients switched to lopinavir/ritonavir after a period of time. Patients who were not Table 1 Demographical and clinical Information, initial outcomes of laboratory tests, management and treatment of 34 patients who were confirmed as being infected with SARS-CoV-2 after admission to Zhongnan Hospital. prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir and patients prior to being prescribed lopinavir/ritonavir tended to have worse manifestations on their chest radiographs (14 out of 16, 87.5%). The intervals between examinations were 4.5 days. Surprisingly, one patient who was prescribed lopinavir/ ritonavir at a later date, and who was re-examined after using lopinavir/ritonavir for four days, showed improvements in his chest radiographs. Even he was worse according to the changes of CT before switching to lopinavir/ritonavir therapy. However, as other patients were not re-examined, more information relating to the effects of lopinavir/ritonavir therapy could not be determined and further investigation and evaluation are needed. As for procalcitonin, of the 11 patients who received re-examination, 4 showed an elevation of procalcitonin, while 3 patients showed the opposite. Only one patient out of the 34 patients was treated with home isolation. All other patients required hospitalization."
611,2985489,"Thirty-two 5-week-old pigs were obtained from an influenza virus-seronegative farm. Pigs were randomly assigned to four groups of eight pigs. Each group was housed in a separate biosafety level-2 HEPA-filtered isolation unit. Before the start of the experiment, all pigs were seronegative to any of the European endemic H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2 SIVs, as determined by HI test, immunoperoxidase monolayer assay, and a competitive anti-influenza A NP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Idexx Laboratories, Hoofddorp, the Netherlands). After acclimation for 1 week, three groups were inoculated with A/Vic/75, A/Wis/05, or sw/Gent/08, respectively. One group was left uninoculated and served as the challenge control group. Six weeks later, all groups were challenged with sw/Gent/08. All inoculations were performed intranasally with 7Á0 log 10 50% egg infective doses (EID 50 ) influenza virus in 3 ml (1Á5 ml per nostril) as described elsewhere. 26 Pigs were observed daily for clinical signs from 4 days before until 7 days after each inoculation, or until euthanasia. To determine virus excretion, nasal swabs were collected daily from all pigs from 0-7 days post-primary inoculation (dpi) and from 0-7 days post-challenge (dpc), or until euthanasia. Four pigs per group were euthanized at 3 dpc and gross lung lesions were assessed as described elsewhere. 27 To determine the extent of replication of the sw/ Gent/08 challenge virus in the respiratory tract, tissue samples of the upper (nasal mucosa respiratory part and olfactory part, tonsil, and trachea) and lower (apical, cardiac, and diaphragmatic lobes of the left and right lung) respiratory tract were collected and titrated separately. Blood samples for serological examinations were collected at the start of the experiment, 14 and 42 dpi, that is, at the time of challenge with sw/Gent/08. The remaining pigs were also bled at 5, 7, 10, and 14 dpc."

613,909706,"Electron microscopy (EM) is one of the oldest direct examination methods that has been implemented for both clinical viral diagnosis and study of viral ultrastructure and pathogenesis in developed countries (Roingeard, 2008) . Historically, EM has played an instrumental role in identifying novel viral strains in several outbreak situations, such as the coronavirus associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak (Falsey and Walsh, 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) . However, despite several advantages, the use of EM has been limited in respiratory viral diagnosis as it is expensive, laborious, time-consuming, and has a greater turnaround time (approximately 3-16 h including specimen preparation), and is often insensitive when compared to other diagnostic methods (Goldsmith and Miller, 2009; Zhang et al., 2013) . Additionally, EM requires strict control of experimental conditions, a high concentration of viral particles (> 10 5 L −1 ), and considerable technical skill and expertise for accurate analysis."
614,826991,"An important aspect of this collaborative approach is trust and situation awareness. During the H1N1 pandemic in Taiwan, despite mass production of a vaccine, a negative media story centred around the death of a physicians' son led to a significant loss of trust. 11 Not only were vaccinations refused but this lack of trust then also extended to government recommendations and inhibited protective measures. Situation awareness, so easily lost on a macro-scale again reflects the dynamic, ever-changing environment that is not dissimilar to an operating room 12 . Errors on a local level but magnified on a national and international setting may occur often because of tunnel vision toward achieving a particular action or goal to the exclusion of all other factors. Conversely, relevant information may be present yet ignored due to distraction or hierarchy or a combination of these factors. 13 Examples of this may include panic-buying items despite no suggestion of shortage in supplies or ability to access, listening to local evidence and policy to the exclusion of globally available information and changing events. A government plea for businesses to help in the manufacture and production of ventilators was met with positive pledges from multiples businesses, related and not, to aid in the production of these vital machines. An important aspect missed in the early rush to produce more physical machines was the awareness of training need, recognising the deployment of healthcare workers from a familiar to an unfamiliar environment and different devices having different operational instructions. This very human and relevant clinical factor applies equally to the rapid production of safe machines that make it easy to use under considerable stress and pressure. To this end, further guidance has been appropriately released for a rapidly manufactured ventilator system specification that is minimally, clinically acceptable. 14 Other successful collaborations include that of telecommunication companies. These have recently committed to combined resources to support the government and NHS with broadband and mobile network services to support the almost overnight conversion of physical GP and outpatient appointments to remote and digital consultations. 12"

Strategic treatments eliminate tangible factors that contribute to weaken the immune system.

617,2471437,"The availability of the virus' genetic sequence and initial data on the epidemiology and clinical consequences of the 2019-nCoV infections are only the first steps to understanding the threat posed by this pathogen. Many important questions remain unanswered, including its origin, extent, and duration of transmission in humans, ability to infect other animal hosts, and the spectrum and pathogenesis of human infections. Characterising viral isolates from successive generations of human infections will be key to updating diagnostics and assessing viral evolution. Beyond supportive care, 17 no specific coronavirus antivirals or vaccines of proven efficacy in humans exist, although clinical trials of both are ongoing for MERS-CoV and one controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy has been launched for 2019-nCoV (ChiCTR2000029308). Future animal model and clinical studies should focus on assessing the effectiveness and safety of promising antiviral drugs, monoclonal and polyclonal neutralising anti body products, and therapeutics directed against immunopathologic host responses."
618,284600,"Glucocorticoids have been widely used in the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and are now also used in conjunction with other drugs to treat patients infected with 2019-nCoV. However, in the published clinical management opinions for the COVID-19, the application of glucocorticoids is not recommended unless there are other indications. [13, 14] The use of glucocorticoids may delay the clearance of viral nucleic acids in patients and should be avoided during viral replication. Some bias exists in our study because the patients in the glucocorticoid treatment group had more severe disease and lower CD4+ T lymphocytes counts. Our point is that mild patients are not recommended glucocorticoid treatment, which may delay virus clearance. The randomized controlled doubleblind experiments with expanded sample sizes will help clarify this issue. T cell immunity may play an important role in 2019-nCoV infection. The absolute values of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CRP, ESR, and PCT measured upon admission were analyzed with respect to virus clearance. The lower the absolute value of CD4+ T lymphocytes before treatment, the longer duration of virus clearance. The relationship between the fecal viral RNA results and inflammatory indicators of patients were analyzed and no statistical difference in ESR, CRP, or PCT during rehabilitation was found."

The annual distribution indicated that genotype A2 and genotype B1 prevailed alternately. Previous studies have reported the prevalence of certain predominant hMPV genotypes in a given year. hMPV sub-genotypes may vary in different years and alternative predominance of hMPV sub-genotypes has been observed [Matsuzaki et al., 2008; Pitoiset et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2013] . The present study found that the epidemiological characteristics and clinical features were fundamentally similar among patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV, which is consistent with the results of some studies [Bosis et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2013] . Diarrhea was a clinical manifestation that occurred more frequently in patients infected with type B hMPV compared with patients infected with type A hMPV in this study. However, there are different epidemiological and clinical findings in other two studies [Matsuzaki et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2012] . Furthermore, a study indicated that patients with type A hMPV infection are often associated with more severe symptoms [Vicente et al., 2006] .

622,2039640,"Coronavirus spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) envelope proteins are highly immunogenic and constitute important antigenic targets for the development of serologic assays (11, 21) . As with SARS-CoV-1, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the cell surface angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor (21) (22) (23) . Host neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) appear to be predominantly directed at the S protein (24) . The N protein plays crucial roles in viral replication and assembly, is highly conserved, and induces antibodies sooner than S during infection (6, 25, 26) . Commercial SARS-CoV-2 serologic assay development has focused on enzyme immunoassays, such as laboratory-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) and rapid lateral flow assays (LFAs). More complex serum neutralization assays are important as a reference standard and to assess immunity."
623,2037946,"Several studies focusing on the different types of PEDV strains allowed for a better understanding of PEDV epidemiology and pathogenicity. Because of a very low infectious dose (Thomas et al., 2015) , PEDV can be transmitted by contact with contaminated equipment, the staff or contaminated vehicles used for animal transport (Bowman, Krogwold, Price, Davis, & Moeller, 2015; Jung & Saif, 2015; Lowe et al., 2014) , but oro-faecal transmission is the main transmission route. PEDV is shed in faeces favouring a rapid transmission to susceptible pigs sharing the same environment as infected animals (Jung & Saif, 2015) . Airborne transmission was evidenced over relatively long distances for non-InDel strains (Alonso et al., 2014) , but still needs to be investigated as a potential transmission route for InDel PEDV strains."
624,454801,"Before an HRV can enter a cell, it must pass through a defensive barrier of secreted anti-HRV antibody, mostly IgA. The ease with which this passage occurs is proportional to the progression of clinical disease. Healthy adult volunteers were found to develop IgA by at least 3 days to 2 weeks after inoculation-about the same time as serum antibody-and retain peak levels for at least 8 weeks [ 178 , 344 -346 ] , falling faster than serum levels [ 347 , 348 ] . There is also some evidence for a degree of nasal immune memory [ 347 ] . Volunteers with pre-study serum antibody could still be infected in some studies [ 46 , 210 , 292 ] , but not in others [ 349 ] . Infection is more clear in volunteers without preexisting nasal antibody to experimental challenge virus; they become infected, exhibit more severe ARI, and shed more virus for longer [ 292 , 347 ] . IgA does not seem to modify illness severity or virus shedding, but high levels prevent reinfection by the initiating virus type. Low levels or absence of IgA does not prevent reinfection by the same HRV type, which may manifest as symptomatic or asymptomatic disease [ 349 ] . Older children, adolescents, and adults have greater amounts of HRV-neutralizing antibody than young children [ 42 ] , accompanying a trend toward decreasing numbers of symptomatic ARIs with increasing age [ 218 , 350 ] . This feature raises an issue: did the use of older subjects in many common cold studies underplay the pathogenic potential of the HRVs because protective or partially cross-protective antibodies moderated the impact of infection? Consequently, quantifying levels of type-specifi c serum antibody became routine practice prior to some studies. Adult volunteer studies determined that no infections resulted if preexisting neutralizing antibody titers ≥1:16 existed; as levels grew from 0, so did levels of resistance to infection [ 43 , 210 ] . Adults were protected by serum titers of 1:3-1:8 [ 209 , 210 ] . The trend was interrupted by adults in the 20-39 year age group, presumably because they had begun families and their young children acquired and amplifi ed currently circulating types from the community and transmitted them into a household that was either immune naïve or lacking suffi cient antibody or cell-mediated memory for protection [ 351 ] ."

A separate outbreak of the EVD, which is not related to the outbreak in West Africa, was laboratory confirmed on 26 August 2014 by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). There have been 92 cases and 48 deaths so far [1] . Priority responses and actions are needed to tackle the ongoing Ebola crisis in West Africa and this requires improvements in access to diagnostic technologies and healthcare resources, as well as improved surveillance and communication. As it stands, there is little incentive for vulnerable communities to seek professional diagnosis of suspected Ebola. Most people with the flu and febrile illnesses self-medicate and are treated at home or by traditional healers/practitioners, making difficult to define the true extent and nature of the outbreak [2] ."

627,968228,"The only drug routinely available for treatment in veterinary practice shown to be antivirally active in naturally FIV-infected cats which is commercially available at the moment is AZT (zidovudin 3'-azido-2',B'-dideoxythymidine, Retrovir, Glaxo-Wellcome). AZT inhibits virus replication in vitro and in vivo (Hartmann et al., 1992; 1995a,b) . It improves the immunological and clinical status of FIV-infected cats, increases quality of life and prolongs life expectation. It should be used at a dosage of 5 mg kg -1 body weight twice a day orally or by subcutaneous injection. For subcutaneous injection the lyophilized product should be diluted in isotonic NaCI solution to prevent local irritation. For oral application, syrup or gelatine capsules (dosage/weight individually for every cat) can be given. During treatment, regular blood cell counts are necessary because anaemia is a common side effect (Hartmann et al., 1992; 1995a,b) . However, as shown in long-term studies, AZT is well tolerated and there is only mild decrease of haemoglobin values (Hart & Nolte, 1993; Hartmann et al., 1995a,b) . Unfortunately, as BROWN, E.

628,18296,"A 35-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China was confirmed to be first SARS-CoV-2 infected case in Korea. The detailed exposure history and a clinical course of this patient is described in previous report. 7 Viral load kinetics of Patient 1 is shown in Fig. 1A (viral RNA copies) and Supplementary Fig. 1 (reverse Ct value). Briefly, she was quarantined at the airport due to fever (38.3°C) at the entry inspection on January 19, 2020. She had no significant exposure history and developed fever, chills, and myalgia one day before the entry to Korea (January 18, 2020, day 1 of symptom onset). The virus was detected from URT specimens on day 2 of symptom onset. As she did not have significant respiratory symptoms, LRT specimen (spontaneous sputum) was obtained with airway clearance techniques of percussion on day 3. Although any infiltration was not noticed on her chest X-ray (CXR) on the same day, LRT specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2. On day 4, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was taken and multiple ground-glass opacities were observed in both sub-pleural spaces. 7 On day 5, the viral load was increased from day 3 in LRT specimen and she required oxygen supplement via nasal cannula (3 L/min). She eventually developed cough on day 7, and infiltration was observed on CXR from the next day. However, it appeared that the viral loads already started to decrease from around day 7 in both URT and LRT specimens. rRT-PCR continued to be positive at low level until day 13 (LRT specimens) and 14 (URT specimens). On day 12, her CXR was worsened with increase in oxygen requirement up to 10 L/min, while the viral loads dropped significantly from the initial values. Therefore, by the time when the significant infiltration was visible on a plain chest radiography, the viral load might be already on its lower end of detection. From day 14 (LRT specimen) and day 15 (URT specimen), rRT-PCR became undetectable for two consecutive days, respectively. She had mild loose stool from day 4 to day 19. Although RdRp and/or E gene were detected occasionally from urine and stool specimens collected from day 5 to 12, none of specimen satisfied conditions for positivity. Only one serum sample collected on day 8 showed positive rRT-PCR result, but the Ct value was adjacent to the cut-off value for positivity. Her symptoms, oxygen requirement, and CXR findings significantly improved from day 17 and she was discharged on day 20 of symptom onset (February 6, 2019). Patient 2 was a 55-year-old Korean man, who had been working at Wuhan, China, arrived in Korea via Shanghai on January 22, 2020. The detailed exposure history and a clinical course of this patient is described in Supplementary Data 1. Briefly, he did not have any significant exposure history and developed sore throat and intermittent myalgia since January 10 which was controlled by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. He was tested on January 23, 2020, confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection next day and hospitalized on the same day. Therefore, his admission day (January 24) was considered to be the day 15 of symptom onset. His CXR on day 15 showed infiltration and chest HRCT on day 16 showed bilateral groundglass opacity (Supplementary Fig. 3A) . The viral load kinetics are shown in Fig. 1B (viral RNA copies) and Supplementary Fig. 2 (reverse Ct value). In this patient, the initial test was performed on day 14 of symptom onset and SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both URT and LRT specimens. However, the initial viral loads were relatively lower (49,047 copies/mL for URT and 391,243 copies/mL for LRT) than those of Patient 1 (46,971,053 copies/mL for URT and 9,171,220 copies/mL for LRT) in whom the test was performed on day 2 of symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2 was detected a few more times during hospitalization from both URT and LRT specimens at low levels. As he had just mild cough with little or no sputum, LRT specimens In Patient 2, the exact fever duration could not be estimated because he had taken non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent to control his myalgia and sore throat before hospitalization. When his physician discontinued the medication, the fever was observed; b) Patient 2 experienced loose stool after taking Lopinavir/ ritonavir. were available only a few times. From D18 (URT specimen) and D20 (LRT specimen), rRT-PCR became undetectable for two consecutive days, respectively. On day 25, RdRp (Ct value of 36.69) and E (Ct value of 33.18) genes was detected again from the URT sample of day 25, it was interpreted as negative due to high Ct value of RdRp gene. From his plasma and stool specimens, only E genes were once detected on day 17 and it was also interpreted as negative result. His CXR improved from day 19 and he was discharged on day 27 (February 5, 2020)."

Among 33 genotipified RSV, 19 were NA1 genotype (57.6%) belonging to the group A; 13 were B7 (39.4%) and 1 was B9 (3.0%). Both genotypes belong to the group B. The NA1 strains were significantly more frequent in hospitalized infants (p < 0.001) and in severe disease (p = 0.01; OR = 10.0). This difference is mainly supported among infants with severe and mild disease (p < 0.03; OR = 10.0). There were no differences between RSV genotypes and the type of infection, i.e. single infection or co-infection (p = 0.5)."
630,290161,"The flowrate through the filter influences pressure drop. Thus, masks of all three types exhibited a linear relationship between pressure drop and flowrate following the application of each of the decontamination methods. Immersion in bleach increased the pressure drop through the N95 mask (to 40 mm H 2 O at a flowrate of 10 L min −1 ), whereas use of the autoclave reduced it. Similar results were obtained in the tests on the Gauze masks except when bleach was used, because bleach destroyed all of the masks. Decontamination typically increased Δp, but treatment in the autoclave did not do so for the N95 or Gauze masks. The low pressure drop results for these two types of masks were observed to be associated with folds of the inner and outer filter supports. These folds may reduce the uniformity of filter density, causing the air to flow through loose filter material in the mask, and reducing the resistance of the filter. From the observation, as show in Fig 10, the outer layer of the masks were deformed, shrunken and stiff and these phenomena were similar to a previous study [8] . But no remarkable mottle was observed. However, the characteristics of various filters are not easily obtained as this information is commercially sensitive, and this fact imposed a limitation on this study. Filter quality of electret masks in filtering aerosol particles after decontamination Moreover, in the study, the calculated inspiratory breathing resistance (IBR) at 85 L min -1 [23] was 6.5, 2.6 and 0.9 mm H 2 O/L/sec for the pretreated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks, respectively. Previously reported maximum value for the normal threshold for detection of IBR was 7.6 mm H 2 O/L/sec [23] . In the study, the highest IBR value was 15. "

633,437453,"In immunocompetent patients, biomarkers such as PCT and proADM are helpful in the diagnosis and management of severe bacterial infections. 20, 21 Also, in febrile neutropenic patients, high serum PCT and proADM levels have been associated with the diagnosis and the severity of bacterial-fungal infection. 22, 23 It has been speculated that in HSCT recipients, biomarkers might be of particularly utility due to the range of potential complications, both infectious and non-infectious, that these patients may suffer. Previous studies evaluating different biomarkers in this setting have been controversial. 15,24-27 Pihusch et al. 24 evidenced that CRP, PCT and IL-6 levels increase in both infectious and non-infectious complications. Furthermore, these authors showed that plasma levels of PCT were useful for differentiating between infection and other transplant-related complications, although, no details were given on the etiology and localization of the infection, making it difficult to draw comparisons with our own series. By contrast, a meta-analysis that included six different studies and a total of 1344 episodes of suspected systemic infection in the immediate post-transplant period demonstrated that CRP and PCT were neither sensitive nor specific enough for discriminating systemic infection from other inflammatory complications. 26 However, variations in clinical criteria used to define severe systemic infection across studies and the different etiology of fever among the groups compared were an evident source of heterogeneity. 28 The present study confirms the poor discriminative value of these biomarkers for diagnosing RI in this cohort of patients. In fact, the highest values of some of these biomarkers were found in patients with non-infectious RC. These findings are relevant as one of the strengths of the present study is that, contrary to other series, the episodes have been collected prospectively during a 1 year follow-up from a specific cohort of HSCT recipients. Furthermore, we have included only patients with RC and a specific etiology."
634,2387324,"In some instances, mitosis can be inhibited even in the presence of active Cdk1/cyclin B1 complexes, provided they are prevented from accumulating in the nucleus (see Fig. 1 ). The parvovirus B19 NS1 protein mediates G2 arrest despite the presence of active Cdk1/cyclin B1 in the cytoplasm (Morita et al., 2001) . The NS1 protein has nicking and helicase activities that may damage cellular DNA (Momoeda et al., 1994; Poole et al., 2006) , and although the precise mechanism of arrest is unclear, it may involve checkpoint pathways that regulate cyclin B nuclear export. An alternative strategy is used by the E4 protein of HPV16, which prevents the nuclear entry of the Cdk1/cyclin B complex by sequestering the Cdk1/cyclin B kinase complex in the cytoplasm (Davy et al., 2005) . The association of HPV16 E4 with the cytokeratin network is thought to contribute to the ability of E4 to achieve this effect in vivo (Wang et al., 2004) ."

636,2219897,"Modified live virus (MLV) vaccines have been most effective in protecting dogs against canine distemper. Inactivated whole viral vaccines are not effective; however, a vectored recombinant vaccine is currently available. In puppies, distemper vaccination is performed at 3-to 4-week intervals, with the earliest inoculation being given when the puppy is 6 to 8 weeks of age. Most distemper vaccines used in North America today overcome maternal immunity by the time puppies are 12 weeks of age. Vaccination in puppies is usually continued until they reach 16 weeks of age. Dogs older than 12 weeks of age at the time they are presented for initial vaccination should receive at least two canine distemper virus (CDV) inoculations 2 to 3 weeks apart. The minimum duration of immunity, as determined by challenge, to attenuated (MLV) CDV is at least 7 years for vaccines using the Rockport strain of CDV, although that for vaccines using the Onderstepoort strain is at least 5 years. 2 ,29 The recombinant CDV vaccine is a canary pox-vectored vaccine that expresses distemper fusion and hemagglutinin glycoproteins. 23 Dogs receiving this vaccine must receive at least two doses initially. The reported duration of immunity is at least 12 months. Annual booster vaccination is recommended when using this product."
637,687488,"Most researchers pay their attention to the temporal development of epidemics. However, many important epidemiological phenomena are strongly influenced by space because of the localized nature of transmission or other forms of interaction [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . The spread of invading organisms [13, 14] is very important and recent events have focused attention on the spread of human, livestock, crop, and wildlife diseases [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . As a result, mathematical models with time and space are useful in investigating the process of epidemic spreading. Epidemic wavefronts may be found in reaction-diffusion models, which were observed in the real world, such as in the spread of the Black Death in Europe from 1347 to 1350 [20] [21] [22] ."

639,3132049,"While a career in infectious diseases (ID) has always been challenging and exciting, recognition of the value that ID physicians provide to the healthcare system as a whole, over and above the value they provide to individual patients, has been poor in this system. In response to this disparity, the Infectious Diseases Society of America Clinical Affairs Committee has long endeavored to quantify the value of ID physicians to the system, which is challenging in part because of the many avenues through which they influence healthcare. We discuss data showing that ID physicians improve clinical outcomes, positively impact transitions of care, and direct system-level improvements through infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship. We identify areas where value-based care provides additional future opportunities for ID physicians. A Clinical Affairs Committee-sponsored study of ID physicians' positive impact on patient outcomes shows that few medical specialties are better positioned to positively impact the Triple Aim approachbetter health, better care, and lower per capita cost-that is the principle tenet of healthcare system reform."
640,2221290,"The severity of viral coinfections on clinical outcome in these patients is still unclear. Several investigations concluded that viral coinfections are no more severe than single virus infections [6, 7, 9] , or even that there is less severe clinical impact associated with coinfection [5, 6] . On the contrary, some studies have evidence of severe disease outcome from viral coinfections [2, 3] . As an example of the confusion surrounding this issue, Aberle et al. [16] found that the severity of dual infections with non-RSV respiratory viruses are similar to those of single infections, whereas coinfection with RSV is associated with reduced immune responses resulting in a more severe clinical course of lower respiratory tract diseases. Brand et al. [7] also found that RSV associated coinfections are more severe than single RSV infections. Coinfections with influenza A and B viruses also appear to increase severity, leading to higher rates of admission to intensive care units or death [4] ."
641,2553720,"Polyprotein annotation. In all coronavirus genomes, orf1ab occupies two-thirds of the genome and it is translated as a polyprotein. This polyprotein is posttranslationally cleaved by 3C-like protease (3CL pro ) and papain-like protease (PL pro ) into 15-16 non-structural proteins. Some of the non-structural proteins, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, 3CL pro and PL pro are essential for replication or virulence of the coronavirus, although the functions of others are still unclear. Due to the essentiality of the non-structural proteins, these sequences are often used for evolutionary analysis, primer design, etc. However, except for the reference sequences, detailed cleavage site information is not provided for the non-structural proteins in other sequences in GenBank. Since it has been shown that 3CL pro and PL pro of coronavirus cleave at conserved specific amino acids, the putative cleavage sites of the 15-16 non-structural proteins can be predicted by multiple sequence alignment. Using these pieces of information, we have annotated these non-structural proteins in all the coronavirus sequences for easy retrieval in CoVDB. Protein/gene name unification. By convention, all nonstructural proteins in the polyprotein encoded by orf1ab are named as 'nsp', with each protein numbered consecutively starting from the 5 0 end (nsp1-nsp16). The structural proteins after the polyprotein are hemagglutinin esterase (HE, in group 2a coronaviruses), spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). However, there is no unified naming system for the non-structural proteins encoded by ORFs downstream to orf1ab. This lack of a unified system greatly reduces the stability and accuracy of ortholog retrieval."

The distribution of survival time from disease onset to death showed two peaks, with the first one at approximately 14 days (22 cases) and the second one at approximately 22 days (17 cases) (Fig. 1c ). An analysis of the cause of death was performed. Among the 68 fatal cases, 36 patients (53%) died of respiratory failure, five patients (7%) with myocardial damage died of circulatory failure, 22 patients (33%) died of both, and five remaining died of an unknown cause (Fig. 1d) . Based on the analysis of the clinical data, we confirmed that some patients died of fulminant myocarditis. In this study, we first reported that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 may cause fulminant myocarditis. Given that fulminant myocarditis is characterized by a rapid progress and a severe state of illness [3], our results should alert physicians to pay attention not only to the symptoms of respiratory dysfunction but also the symptoms of cardiac injury."

[8, 9] In addition, social distancing is difficult to accomplish since many essential locations like grocery stores have aisles are narrow and result in the proximity of patrons being closer than 1 meter; reduced distance correlates to increased transmission of COVID-19. [10, 11] A lack of definitive data on establishing the effectiveness of using non-medical masks or face coverings has resulted in medical practitioners giving broad public health guidance based on professional judgement only. Existing guidance includes statements that facial coverings may offer minimal protection from small infectious particles, may only reduce large particulate matter, or only remind users to not touch their face considering infectious disease transmission from hand to face. A number of previous studies have been conducted to understand if wearing of masks reduce community infections of common diseases such as influenza, however most are inconclusive due to the application of masks post-exposure or lack of strict wearing compliance by study participants. [12] [13] [14] Only a few well-executed studies conclude the prophylactic wearing of medical grade masks reduce community transmission of influenza or RSV. [15, 16] To make matters worse, the lack of definitive guidance has also led to social and political debates on the wearing of masks or face coverings [17] [18] [19] and deters the acceptance of any new public health strategy for reducing airborne transmission of infectious diseases."

652,619204,"Whenever a serious infectious disease emerges or re-emerges in a human population, a matter of immediate interest is the likely magnitude of the outbreak. This is often called the expected final size of the epidemic (Bailey, 1975; Anderson and Watsons, 1980; Anderson and May, 1991; Andersson and Britton, 2000; Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000) , which we denote Z. Of course, if the emergent pathogen becomes endemic in the population then there will never really be a ""final"" size, but in that case the matter at issue is the likely magnitude of the first major wave of cases."

654,2191202,"Several contrasting findings exist in the literature on ACE2 and cigarette exposure [109] [110] [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] . In particular, it has been reported that nicotine and/or cigarette smoke has the potential to downregulate ACE2 expression in certain tissues or cell types [109] [110] [111] [112] . In this manuscript, we focused our analysis on factors affecting ACE2 expression in the mammalian lungs and associated respiratory epithelia. We observed a consistent correlation between smoking history and ACE2 expression that was dose-dependent ( Figure 2G-H) , that could be recapitulated in mice ( Figure 2A ) and in vitro ( Figure 4M ), that was detectable in both bulk and single-cell analyses ( Figure 2F and 4G-H), and that remained significant when controlling for other demographic variables (Table 1) . Thus, we propose that cigarette smoke causes the upregulation of ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract. However, we recognize that individual components found within cigarettes, like nicotine, may have a different effect on ACE2 than whole smoke, and smoking itself could alter ACE2 levels in non-respiratory organs in different ways 110 ."
655,2206633,"A minority of COVID-19 patients will transition into the third and most severe stage of illness, which manifests as an extra-pulmonary systemic hyperinflammation syndrome. In this stage, markers of systemic inflammation appear to be elevated. COVID-19 infection results in a decrease in helper, suppressor and regulatory T cell counts. 9 Studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, Creactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer are significantly elevated in those patients with more severe disease. 10 Troponin and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) can also be elevated. A form akin to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) may occur in patients in this advanced stage of disease. 11 In this stage, shock, vasoplegia, respiratory failure and even cardiopulmonary collapse are discernable. Systemic organ involvement, even myocarditis, would manifest during this stage. Tailored therapy in stage III hinges on the use of immunomodulatory agents to reduce systemic inflammation before it overwhelmingly results in multi-organ dysfunction. In this phase, use of corticosteroids may be justified in concert with the use of cytokine inhibitors such as tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) or anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist). 11 Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) may also play a role in modulating an immune system that is in a hyperinflammatory state. Overall, the prognosis and recovery from this critical stage of illness is poor, and rapid recognition and deployment of such therapy may have the greatest yield."
656,1501063,"Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is a novel pathogen in the family Coronaviridae, genus Deltacoronavirus, causing enteric disease characterized by watery diarrhoea similar to porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) (Jung et al., 2015) . PDCoV was first discovered in Hong Kong in 2012, during a study to identify novel coronaviruses (Woo et al., 2012) . In February 2014, PDCoV was first detected and reported in Ohio, United States, in association with PED cases. The retrospective investigation demonstrated the presence of PDCoV in the USA as early as 2013 (Sinha et al., 2015) . Since then, PDCoV has been detected in most pig-producing states of the USA (Marthaler et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Homwong et al., 2016) . Recently, PDCoV was identified for the first time in South Korea and China (Lee and Lee, 2014; Song et al., 2015) , and the identification of PDCoV in China was dated back to 2004 (Dong et al., 2015) . Increased identification of PDCoV raises concerns regarding the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this virus. We herein report the identification and molecular characterization of PDCoV identified from piglets with clinical diarrhoea in swine farms in South-East Asian countries (SEAC) including Thailand, Vietnam, Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and Philippines."
657,1723186,"To investigate whether proteolytic cleavage at the basic amino acid residues, were it to occur, might facilitate cell-cell fusion activity, we mutated the wild-type SARS-CoV glycoprotein to construct a prototypic furin recognition site (RRSRR) at either position. Based on our alignment, we engineered three variants ( Fig. 1B) : one at position R667 to replace the resident sequence with YHTRRSRR (referred to as HTR) and another at the same position designed to accommodate the deletion indicated in the alignment, YHTVRRSRR (HTVR). The sequence at K672 (RSTSQK) was shortened to RRSRR in order to include the two naturally occurring basic residues (the SLLR variant). These furin-site-containing glycoproteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and isolated using the C-terminal affinity tag (Fig. 3) . Proteolytic cleavage to yield novel subunits of 110 kDa and 90 kDa was apparent in the HTVR glycoprotein and less so in HTR (top left). Little cleavage was seen in the SLLR glycoprotein. The proteolytically cleaved products appear to be derived from the mature, terminally glycosylated S r form of the S glycoprotein as the 220 kDa form in HTVR was consistently reduced relative to the S s form. This result is in keeping with the subcellular localization of the furin protease in the trans-Golgi network (Molloy et al., 1999; Rockwell et al., 2002) . Upon deglycosylation with PNGase F, the two novel subunits in HTVR and HTR migrated as 72 and 64 kDa peptides (bottom, left), consistent with the anticipated molecular weights of the predicted S1 and S2 polypeptides, respectively. The S2 polypeptide was typically accompanied by lower molecular forms, which suggest additional N-terminal cleavage events. As Fig. 2 . Serine mutation at R667, but not K672, reduces the ability of the S glycoprotein to mediate cell-cell fusion. (A) Wild-type SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and the R667S and K672S mutants were metabolically labeled in COS-7 cells and isolated using the C-terminal S-peptide (Spep) affinity tag (Kim and Raines, 1993) . The mock lane represents cells transfected without vTF7-3 infection. Proteins were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in NuPAGE 3-8% Tris-acetate gels (Invitrogen) either as the isolated glycoproteins (above) or following deglycosylation using PNGase F (below). The Endo-H-resistant (S r ) and Endo-H-sensitive (S s ) forms of the S glycoprotein are indicated, as is the fully deglycosylated S polypeptide (S)."
658,303179,"The 2002-2004 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was a viral respiratory illness caused by SARS-CoV. The outbreak firstly emerged in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong in November 2002 and 68 then spread to 29 countries with 8,096 people infected and 774 died. 69 The SARS global outbreak was contained in July 2003. Since 2004, there have not been any known cases of SARS reported anywhere in the world. 70 Probably, civet cats or bats could be the initial step of the transmission to humans. Humans to humans infection occurs by respiratory droplets or direct contact. Healthcare or household contacts are critical routes of transmission. 71, 72 SARS-CoV infection cases were classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) into suspected, probable, and confirmed ( Table 2) . 73 The median incubation period ranges between 2-11 days. SARS causes atypical pneumonia, which may progress to respiratory failure. Symptoms include fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, and rigors. Adults are more likely to develop severe illness characterized by dyspnea, lymphopenia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and a fatal clinical course in 10% of cases. The exact number of children affected by SARS worldwide is unknown. However, children appear to be less susceptible to SARS with a lower incidence of the disease and no reported mortality. The majority of children had documented exposure to adults with SARS, usually a family member. Most infected children had previously attended school, but the spread of the infection in the school environment has not been demonstrated, and this could probably be linked to lower infectiousness of the virus among children. 74, 75 Children have less severe symptoms than adults, and they rarely need intensive care. However, subclinical and asymptomatic infections appear uncommon. Most children reported worldwide were healthy, previously and underlying conditions were infrequently reported. [75] [76] [77] Usually, children require hospitalization after 3-4 days the onset of symptoms: fever (90-100%), dry cough (43-80%), sore throat (5-30%), rhinorrhea (33-60%), malaise and myalgia (10-40%), headache (14-40%) are common. Dyspnea, tachypnea, and febrile seizures are infrequent. Aspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, appetite lack, vomiting, and diarrhea, have been reported. Physical examination at presentation is negative in the majority of children, and chest auscultation does not reveal significant findings. Moreover, sometimes crackles or signs of lung consolidation can be detected. As well as the clinical examination, laboratory findings are not specific in children with SARS and can be confused with those of other respiratory infections typical of childhood. Commonly lymphopenia, the elevation of transaminases, lactic dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase are detected. Other hematological abnormalities such as leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, the elevation of D-dimer levels and mildly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin times are also observed. [78] [79] [80] Circulating interleukin (IL)-1β levels might be increased, resulting in caspase-1-dependent pathway activation responsible for an exaggerated and persistent inflammatory response and the consequent respiratory failure in severe cases. 81 In children, radiological findings are nonspecific and similar to other viral respiratory abnormalities.

659,922450,"Residual activities were mainly related to urgent endoscopies and outpatients' visits. This activity reduction could be due both to the re-assignment of gastroenterologists to COVID-19 Units and to the infective risks related to endoscopy; indeed, several position papers highlighted a significant risk of diffusion of respiratory diseases which could be spread via an airborne route, including aspiration of oral and fecal material via endoscopes [13, 14] . In addition, it is worth noting the number of participants that referred the presence of a COVID-19 positive colleague (28.4%), with a median reported rate of 10% of healthcare professionals affected COVID-19 in the Gastroenterology Units of practice. Nevertheless, we cannot assess whether the infected COVID-19 physicians were working in COVID-19 Units or not or if there is an overlap of responses from participants working in the same center, thus influencing the estimated infection rate. However, these data are in line with a recent Italian report describing the rate of COVID-19 infected physicians in Gastroenterology Units [15] . Beyond the risk of transmission related to the management of COVID-19 patients [16] , it should be underlined that cautionary measures need to be taken in all gastroenterological settings, especially in the Endoscopy Department [13] . These measures involve a preventive phone call to assess the health state of the patient before coming to the hospital and to explore the possible presence of symptoms or contacts with COVID-19 infected individuals, social distancing in the waiting room, recommendations for the patients to wear a surgical mask and gloves and the correct use from healthcare professionals of gloves, goggles, face shields, gowns, and protective respiratory equipment [13] . However, we believe that our reported rate of infected healthcare professionals is far from being acceptable in Europe and that, as a consequence, additional educational intervention are needed. For instance, on February 20 th , 2020, more than 2 thousand healthcare professionals in China were reported to be COVID-19 positive; based on these data the Chinese central government started interventions for improving the correct use of PPE, strengthened logistics, medical supplies and enhanced disinfection [17] so that this model of possible intervention should be applied also in Europe. Interestingly, only 14.8% of participants referred to have been tested themselves for COVID-19 although 28.4% of them reported that a colleague was infected. These facts underline the need for periodical screening programs for healthcare professionals [18, 19] . However, even though the participants were tested only in case of close contacts with infected colleagues, our data still show that only 50% of participants with an infected colleague were tested; thus, the conclusion that may be drawn is that this emerging COVID-19 under-testing policy could influence the spread of the infection not only among healthcare professionals but also among patients [19] ."
660,1670825,"The general public may be idealistic in their belief that risk-free blood products are achievable in today's world. In fact, the threat of infectious agents entering the blood supply is not static and may evolve as new pathogens emerge or as old ones change their epidemiological pattern. Nevertheless, the goal of a safe and affordable blood supply that can meet the growing global demands may be reached by the coordinated optimization of each step in the transfusion chain, including the careful consideration of donor eligibility criteria, adherence to rigorous rules during donation, processing and storage, the optimal implementation of available screening tests, the use of suitable pathogen inactivation methods and finally the vigilance of prudent physicians, who evaluate the necessity of each transfusion. Efforts invested in providing lowest possible risk blood products need to be matched by the diligence of physicians administering the transfusions who need to report adverse consequences of blood transfusions. Hence, national haemovigilance systems linked to an international network are becoming indispensable elements of blood product safety and quality. Combined with the development and implementation of sensitive and affordable detection and inactivation approaches, these measures can make blood transfusion a safer form of therapy even in places where the risks to date have to be considered significant [5, 6, 144, 145] ."
661,1794453,"The COVID-19 pandemic is happening as this editorial is being written, and the circumstances are rapidly changing day to day. An analogous situation is currently being faced by physicians in Italy, with escalating numbers of critically ill patients and dwindling capacity for ventilatory support. Calls to frontline staff have been made for a ""soft utilitarian"" approach in the face of resource scarcity. We hope to have highlighted the challenges of testing capabilities in the midst of a pandemic outbreak of a novel pathogen. As laboratorians we need to stay informed of the hospital situation and policies, as they will be changing continually. We need to disseminate information to our staff, be nimble in our response, and relay information to the hospital administration about the situation in the laboratory. In other words, manage the flow of information simultaneously from both above and below."

An infection can cause respiratory distress, fever, anorexia and subcutaneous emphysema and can lead to secondary bacterial pneumonia and death [6, 7] . Outbreaks of BCV and BRSV occur mainly in autumn and winter [8, 9] . These infections are common in dairy herds; in a nationwide survey in England and Wales the prevalence of antibodies to these viruses in bulk tank milk (BTM) was 100% [10] . Swedish studies have shown a prevalence of 70-100% for BCV and 41-89% for BRSV, with the higher prevalence in southern parts [7, 11] .

As animals were integrated into husbandry at different time points, the observation period varied between the animals. In totally six out of eleven shrews (female #2, male #5, female #6, male #9, male #10, male #12) natural BoDV-1-infection was confirmed by detection of viral RNA, in three out of eleven shrews (female #2, male #5, female #6) additionally by detection of infectious virus. Two of the naturally infected shrews (male #5, female #6) died about 9 weeks after the start of the observation period (see below). The five other shrews did not exhibit any evidence for BoDV-1-infection, neither infectious virus nor viral RNA was detected at any time point investigated. During the whole observation period up to 600 days, activity and behaviour during day or night light regime and food intake did not differ between infected and noninfected animals. Furthermore, there was no significant difference of relative body mass trend between infected and non-infected individuals (Mann-Whitney U-test, p > 0.06 for each comparison) (Fig 1) . There was also no significant difference of relative body mass trend between different weeks in husbandry of non-infected animals (Kruskal-Wallis-Test: H(10;42) = 4.3123; p = 0.9322) and between different weeks in husbandry of infected animals (Kruskal-Wallis-Test: H(10;50) = 6,8237; p = 0.7420).

665,845570,"They are due to the high reflectivity of the normally aerated lung surface and characterize the visual representation of the multiple reflections happening between the US transducer and the lung surface itself. 3,5,7 • Score 1: The pleural line is indented. Below the indent, vertical areas of white are visible. These are due to local alterations in the acoustical properties of the lung, as, for example, the replacement of volumes previously occupied by air in favor of media that are acoustically much more similar to the intercostal tissue (water, blood, and tissue). This phenomenon opens channels accessible to US, which can explain the appearance of the vertical artifacts. 3,5,7 • Score 2: The pleural line is broken. Below the breaking point, small-to-large consolidated areas (darker areas) appear with associated areas of white below the consolidated area (white lung). The darkening of the consolidated areas signals the loss of aeration and the transition of these areas toward acoustic properties similar to soft tissue over the entire area represented by the consolidation itself. Beyond the consolidations, the appearance of areas of white lung signals the presence of areas not yet fully deaerated, where air inclusions are still present but embedded in tissuelike material. This highly scattering environment can explain this peculiar pattern. 3,5,7 • Score 3: The scanned area shows dense and largely extended white lung with or without larger consolidations."

The pseudotype assay was thus shown to be both sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, with no evidence for cross-reaction with the other human coronaviruses. Although the live virus assay was based on the Frankfurt SARS-CoV isolate, and the pseudotype assay was based on the Urbani isolate, they gave equivalent titers, including analysis of serum from the person from whom the Frankfurt isolate was made."
675,2604795,"A human strain of MERS-CoV was isolated in our laboratory from a French patient hospitalised in June 2013 after a nosocomial transmission. 5 The viral strain MERS-CoV Hu/France-FRA2_130569/2013 (FRA2) was grown on MRC5 cells (RD-Biotech REF-84002) for the first passage and on Vero E6 cells (ATCC â CRL-1586) for the second passage. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM 1X, GIBCO; Invitrogen, Saint Aubin, France) and supplemented with 5% foetal calf serum (FCS), antibiotics (0Á1 units penicillin, 0Á1 mg streptomycin per ml, GIBCO; Invitrogen) at 37°C in humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The cell culture supernatant was used for inactivation assays and whole-genome sequencing (manuscript under submission). Culture supernatants (500 ll) with a titre of 10 5Á59 TCID 50 per ml were submitted to three temperatures over time and tested for infectivity by TCID 50 method on Vero E6 cells as described previously, except that examination for cytopathic effect was performed after 6 days. 4 Several time points were chosen (0, 0Á5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes). Each condition was performed in triplicates, and the whole experiment was accomplished twice. Experimental data from one experiment are shown in Table 1 . For each condition, we determined the virucidal activity of heat at 56 and 65°C, which corresponded to a reduction of 4 log 10 of the titre according to the European Standards (NF EN 14476 available at http://www.afnor.org/; Table 2 ). At 56°C, which is the common temperature used for inactivation of enveloped viruses, such as influenza viruses, and serum decomplementation, almost 25 minutes were necessary to reduce the initial titre by 4 log 10 . Increasing temperature to 65°C had a strong negative effect on viral infectivity as virucidy dropped significantly to 1 minute. Fifteen minutes at 65°C is more than sufficient to totally inactivate the sample. By contrast, no decrease in titre was observed after 2 hours at 25°C. Serum heat inactivation at 56°C for 30 minutes is a standard procedure in diagnostic laboratories to eliminate the potential complement interference in serological assays. Our results showed that this procedure is sufficient for viral inactivation as virus titres in blood are expected to be weaker than at the point of infection. This would be also sufficient for inactivation of viruses present in lower respiratory specimens, which are now recommended by WHO rather than nasopharyngeal swabs for viral diagnosis. For example, the FRA2 original clinical specimen (induced sputum) contained 6Á5 9 10 7 genome copies per ml for Orf1a calculated from the C t values using a standard (manuscript under submission). These data might be also useful in establishing biosafety measures in laboratories against MERS-CoV. Slope (a), y-intercept (b) and x-intercept values of the linear regression straight lines calculated from TCID 50 values (ND values in Table 1 were not included in the calculation). Virucidy corresponded to the duration necessary to obtain a fourfold reduction of the titre in log 10 . The values in brackets corresponded to the 99% confidence intervals. NA, not applicable. Each condition was performed in triplicates. The whole experiment was performed twice with similar results (data not shown)."
676,605975,"demand with limited manufacturing capacity of RT-PCR kits, especially in less-developed countries. 2) False-negative RT-PCR results have been broadly reported. 3, 4 Given the aforementioned challenges, chest computed tomography (CT) has been strongly recommended and encouraged for screening for COVID-19. 5, 6 Ai et al suggested that chest CT has ultra-high sensitivity (97%) for diagnosing COVID-19. 3 Besides, excellent performance of chest CT has been reported for diagnosing cases with negative RT-PCR results. 7 Previous studies have reported the clinical and CT imaging features of COVID-19. 8, 9 Typical CT findings include ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO with consolidation, crazy paving pattern, or consolidation in a peripheral, posterior, and diffuse or lower lung zone. [10] [11] [12] CT is helpful to guide clinical management and surveil the progression of COVID-19. Because of the rapid progression of COVID-19, the interval between the initial confirmation and the transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) can be as short as a day. 11 Patients often receive more than one chest CT during their disease episode. 3, 13 Hence, there is a theoretical radiation risk to these often young patients. An image modality without ionizing radiation would be of great clinical significance for evaluating COVID-19. 14 As an image modality without ionizing radiation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be a potential alternative to CT for pulmonary application. Being less susceptible to fast T 2 * decay as well as respiratory motions, respiratorygated ultrashort echo time MRI (UTE-MRI) has shown utility in pulmonary applications. [15] [16] [17] Ohno et al concluded that UTE-MRI could be applied for visualizing the GGO, consolidation, and so on, in high concordance with CT. 18 We therefore hypothesized that UTE-MRI may serve as a valuable technique for noninvasively assessing COVID-19. Based on the aforementioned points, this study aimed to evaluate the clinical potential of UTE-MRI for assessing COVID-19 with CT as the reference according to both a lesion-based and patient-based comparative analysis."
677,1628772,"Microorganisms responsible for CAP in the ICU mirror those of the outpatient setting, with the addition of gram-negative pathogens and MRSA. A review of 9 studies of patients with CAP admitted to the ICU showed that the most common typical bacterial pathogens were S. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, Haemophilus influenzae, aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and S. aureus [7] . The relative frequency of atypical pathogens in the ICU setting is unclear because of heterogeneity in diagnostic technique but is approximately 20 % [2] . Respiratory viruses, either as a pure or co-infection, can be detected in up to 49 % of severe pneumonias. Common culprits include parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus [8, 9] . Much less common viral pathogens include coronaviruses, such as the SARS virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), parechoviruses, and enteroviruses. Epidemiologic risk factors are helpful to suggest less common etiologies (Table 20. 2). Structural lung disease (e.g. COPD with repeated exacerbations or bronchiectasis), prior hospitalization and healthcare exposure pose an increased risk of Pseudomonas, chronic alcoholism is a risk for other gram-negative pathogens (Klebsiella pneumoniae or Acinetobacter species), and end-stage renal disease, injection drug use, prior influenza infection, and prior treatment with fluoroquinolones pose an increased risk of S. aureus [2] ."

680,1630563,"In our study, RSV was the predominant virus detected and was most commonly found in children <1 year of age. RSV has been reported to be an important pathogen in children and especially in young infants in several studies [12, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . In addition, RSV detection has been reported to be strongly associated with illness from studies comparing symptomatic cases to controls [30] . Rhinovirus was the second most commonly detected virus (29 %) with similar rates among infants <1 year of age and children aged 1-4 years, which has been reported in previous studies [31, 32] . However, other studies reported RV as the most prevalent virus among children <5 years of age [16, 23, 28, 33] . In addition RV has been commonly detected among asymptomatic persons in several studies indicating that RV can act as both pathogen and by-stander, consequently hindering the ability to infer an association between detection and illness [34] [35] [36] . Among the PIV and CV detected in this study, PIV type 3 and CV type OC43 were the most common virus types, which has been reported in other studies [12, 16] ."
681,1820208,"PDCoV has become a common swine enteric pathogen with worldwide distribution and may have a potential broad host range, including humans and birds (Figure 7) . To date, all the members of the DCoVs genus except PDCoV have been detected in birds. In our study, we found that the PDCoV can infect chickens, indicating that PDCoV may cross the species barrier from avian/birds to some mammals ( Figure 7) . However, our study can not demonstrate if PDCoV has the ability for direct interspecies transmission between pigs and chickens at present. The aminopeptidase N (APN) is a protein receptor, and is mainly targeted by a number of alphacoronaviruses, including TGEV and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) [26] . Recent reports also showed that PDCoV can efficiently infect human origin cells via interacting with the human APN receptor [26] , suggesting that there are potential possibilities for PDCoV to cross the species barriers to infect humans (Figure 7) . To define the natural host and/or reservoir of PDCoV, further molecular surveillance study and experiments on artificial infection of different animals with PDCoV are needed to investigate the interspecies transmission of PDCoV. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that chicken embryos and SPF chickens are susceptible to PDCoV infection. PDCoV-inoculated chickens showed low fecal viral RNA shedding, extensive tissue tropism with moderate viral RNA titer, and mild lesions on intestinal tissues. However, there were no obvious clinical symptom in PDCoV-inoculated chickens. These results provide new insight into a novel host range and the cross-species transmission of PDCoV. "
682,1119018,"In addition to protecting continuity of medication supply at the community pharmacy level, it is equally important that patients maintain adherence to their current treatment regimens in order to prevent any deterioration in their current health status that could ultimately place additional demand on currently overburdened health services. 29 According to World Health Organisation (WHO), rational use of drugs necessitate that patients receive 'medicines appropriate to their clinical needs, in doses, that meet their own individual requirements, for an adequate period of time, and at the lowest cost to them and their community'. 26 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a health advisory urging physicians to advise patients on the harms associated with misusing non-pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate to prevent infection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The advisory is in response to the widespread news regarding two individuals who ingested non-pharmaceutical chloroquine phosphate, a chemical mainly used for aquariums. One of the individuals died shortly after arriving at the hospital, however, the second individual reported to the media upon recovery that they ingested the chemical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection."
683,393216,"The most widely used approach to the expression of foreign proteins in plants is stable genetic transformation. This involves integration of heterologous genes into the chromosomes of a host plant and has been used successfully to express a number of immunologically active proteins (see Chapter 58). An alternative approach involves the use of plant virus-based vectors. One of the main attractions of this approach is that viral genomes multiply within infected cells, potentially leading to very high levels of protein expression. Additional advantages include the fact that viral genomes are very small and therefore relatively easy to manipulate and that the infection process is simpler than transformation/ regeneration. There are, inevitably, disadvantages to the approach: the foreign gene is not heritable, there are limitations on the size and complexity of the sequences that can be expressed in a genetically stable manner, and there are concerns about the ability of modified viruses to spread in the environment. Nonetheless, the virus vector approach has been used to express a number of immunologically active proteins, and this article reviews the progress in the field and problems that remain to be solved."
684,265051,"French doctors conducted an open-label non-randomized clinical trial, and 20 patients with COVID-19 who received hydroxychloroquine treatment showed good efficacy [9] . Both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are weak bases and are able to accumulate in acidic organelles (e.g. lysosomes); as such, they can increase endosomal/lysosomal pH and inhibit viral replication [10] . In addition to their antimalarial and antiviral effects, their anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus erythematosus. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can inhibit major histocompatibility complex class II expression, antigen presentation and immune activation (reducing CD154 expression by T cells) via Toll-like receptor signalling and cGAS stimulation of interferon genes [11] . Thus, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can reduce the production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, interferon-α and tumour necrosis factor, which are involved in the cytokine storm [11] . These immunomodulatory effects synergize their antiviral effects in the treatment of COVID-19."

686,2175497,"In conclusion, severe RSV infections were in part influenced by the emergence of strain NA1. However, in our experience and according to other authors, we postulate that in infants younger than 6 months of age, the clinical severity of RSV infection is mainly due to the profile of immune response that is induced by the virus in each individual child [1, 14, 25] . In contrast, in very young infants infected by HRV, the relative immaturity of the immune system may avoid the induction of an intense inflammatory response, as it is seen in older infants or in atopic individuals throughout life. In the future, it will be necessary to compare meticulously the profile of the immune response on different cohorts with rhinovirus infection."
687,374278,"During the last decade, many viruses were found to induce PI3K/Akt signalling and thereby suppress apoptosis of the infected cells through expression of viral gene products (Cooray, 2004) . The majority of reports focused on DNA tumour viruses as cell death suppression is crucial for tumour growth. Thus, the role of PI3K was studied in the context of survival during chronic and latent infections (Cooray, 2004) . The viral LMP1 protein of Epstein-Barr virus regulates B-cell survival, the viral E5 protein of Papillomavirus functions as an apoptosis supressor in epithelial cells and the viral HBx protein of Hepatitis B viruses inhibits TGF-b-induced apoptosis in hepatoma cells (Cooray, 2004) . All these viral proteins induce PI3K signalling that contributes to their cell death suppressing function."
688,1545822,"As for the distribution of the two most represented infections, 188/284 (66.2%) episodes of HRV and RSV infection or co-infection interested immunocompetent infants and young children (15 cases of double infection), while 41 (14.4%) affected young immunocompromised patients (3 cases of double infection), and 55 (19.4%) adult (n ¼ 13 immunocompetent, and n ¼ 42 immunocompromised) patients (Table I) . However, while the absolute number of HRV and RSV infections was significantly higher in young immunocompetent patients compared to young immunocompromised and adult patients, the percentage of HRV infections was comparable in young and adult immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. On the contrary, the percentage of RSV infections was significantly higher in pediatric immunocompetent patients compared to other groups. In addition, the ratio of HRV/RSV infections was 0.6 (predominant RSV infections) in pediatric immunocompetent patients, whereas it was 1.7 in young immunocompromised patients. In both groups of adults, the ratio was greater than 2.0 in immunocompromised, and greater than 3.0 in immunocompetent patients (Table I) ."
689,787687,"Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share only 82% RNA sequence identity, their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) shares 96% sequence identity [11] . Therefore, drugs targeting viral RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV are likely to be effective for SARS-CoV-2. For the RdRp target in the genus Betacoronavirus , there are several potential drugs or compounds, including favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, galidesivir, remdesivir, 6 -fluorinated aristeromycin analogues and acyclovir fleximer analogues [12] . Remdesivir (GS-5734), the phosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine C-nucleoside [13] , has a similar structure to tenofovir alafenamide, which is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine 5-monophosphate with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

690,516746,"It is suspected that SARS-CoV-2-similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV-began as a zoonotic coronavirus that subsequently spread to humans. 1 Community and healthcare-associated person-to-person transmission were documented early in the pandemic, and direct or close contact with infectious persons is believed to be the major mode of transmission. [28] [29] Transmission occurs through exposure to infectious droplets originating from the respiratory tract; infectious droplets may be released from an infected individual via sneezing, coughing, talking or undergoing an A C C E P T E D aerosolizing procedure such as intubation or autopsy. [30] [31] Reportedly droplets do not typically spread beyond 6 feet (2 meters) nor linger in air, although some evidence has suggested a longer range of spread may be possible. [31] [32] Less commonly infection may arise as a result of indirect transmission through fomites, especially if the eyes, face, or mouth are contacted after touching an infected surface. 31, 33 SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in blood and anal swabs; increasing evidence suggests that fecal-oral transmission may be another potential route of spread.

The absence of a correlation is consistent with previous observations 37 and is likely due to the fact that the formation of stem 2 and minor-groove triples (formed between stem 1 and loop 2) in a pseudoknot may exert a coupling effect in stabilizing stem 1 as has been observed in recent nanopore pseudoknot unzipping experiments 45 .

694,957699,"Respiratory tract infections are a global public health concern and in Canada is the eighth leading cause of death in 2009 [1] . Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an RNA virus belonging to Paramyxoviridae family. The virus was identified by researchers in the Netherlands in 2001 as an important cause of respiratory infections that affect all age groups [2] . A study from Saskatchewan, Canada by Liu et al. [3] , using ELISA showed that seroprevalence for hMPV approaches 99% by young adulthood. This virus can affect any age group but several studies have shown that hMPV is a leading cause in lower respiratory tract infections in children [4] [5] [6] but it also affects the elderly [7] . Clinical manifestations are similar to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) primarily leading to pneumonia and bronchiolitis [8] . In Canada, outbreaks associated with hMPV have been reported in Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec mainly in long term and senior care facilities [9] [10] [11] . Other common respiratory viruses in these settings include influenza A (FLUA), influenza B (FLUB), parainfluenza virus (PIV), enterovirus/rhinovirus (ERV), adenovirus (ADV), and coronavirus (CRV), which all can cause lower respiratory tract infections [12, 13] ."
695,1776314,"Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are the most common infections in humans of all ages. Children and infants are one of the most vulnerable groups of the population, and ARIs are the most common cause of children's hospitalization worldwide [1] . Although bacteria, fungi, and parasites can cause ARIs, respiratory viruses cause the majority of infections. Most respiratory virus infections in early childhood are confined to the upper respiratory tract. About one-third of infants develop lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) [2] . The most common causative viral agents of ARIs in children, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza viruses (Flu), and adenoviruses (AdV), were the subject of intensive research for years; therefore, clinical characteristics and regional epidemiological features of those ARIs in Croatia are well known [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, the list of respiratory viruses is growing due to the rapid advance of laboratory diagnostic methods. In the last ten years, newly discovered viruses have been identified including human bocavirus (HBoV), coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), new enterovirus (HEV), parechovirus (HPeV), and rhinovirus (HRV) strains [7] . Additionally, despite the fact that some of the respiratory viruses have been well known for a long time, particularly parainfluenza type 4 (PIV-4), the technically demanding cultivation methods and unavailability of commercial tests made it difficult to diagnose PIV-4's infection [8, 9] . Infections caused by some 2 Journal of Pathogens of the newly discovered viruses (i.e., HBoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) as well as those difficult to cultivate (PIV- 4) have not been recorded in the country yet. There are few recent studies from the region providing valuable but still insufficient data regarding regional epidemiology of infections caused by the abovementioned viruses [10, 11] . Furthermore, the issue of multiple respiratory virus detection, which occurred because of high sensitivity of molecular methods, complicates the interpretation of laboratory diagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine the viral etiology for sixteen viruses tested by multiplex PCR method among children with ARI admitted to the hospital in Zagreb region in two respiratory seasons, in order to demonstrate the need for molecular diagnostics introduced in routine practice. Also, we aimed to investigate the characteristics of infections with single and multiple virus detection, especially regarding the type of virus involved and severity of infection."
696,1187101,"In the present paper, we report the immunolocalization of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the functional receptor for SARS-CoV, in human tissues. The most remarkable finding is the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine, ie cells in contact with the external environment. Furthermore, ACE2 is present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all of the organs studied. These data are consistent with previous findings that low levels of ACE2 mRNA are found in many tissues and that ACE2 mRNA is highly expressed in renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal tissues [8, 10, 12] . The physiological role of ACE2 in most tissues has not been elucidated, although ACE2 is thought to be an essential regulator of cardiac function and blood pressure control [9] , possibly by acting as a natural counterpart of ACE1 [14] . ACE2 has recently been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV [7] . Li et al showed that ACE2 can be immunoprecipitated by the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV virus and that ACE2 can promote viral replication. The demonstration of ACE2 expression in human organs can potentially identify the possible routes of infection for SARS-CoV, and possible routes of spread and replication throughout the body."
697,2008221,"PRRSV infection in pigs may last for a prolonged period of up to 180 days (Wills et al., 2003; Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Albina et al., 1994; Lamontagne et al., 2003) . Studies show that PRRSV is highly susceptible to the action of type I IFNs in cells (Albina et al., 1998; Overend et al., 2007) , suggesting that the virus may function to inhibit IFN-α response as this cytokine is not detectable in the lungs of pigs where PRRSV actively replicates by infecting alveolar macrophages (Buddaert et al., 1998; van Reeth et al., 1999; Luo et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2004) . The molecular basis for IFN suppression by PRRSV has not been studied but the involvement of NF-κB has been excluded since it is up-regulated by the virus (Lee and Kleiboeker, 2005) . Impairment of IFN-α production by PRRSV would affect the development of an effective T helper type 1 (Th1) response and lead to a weakly induced cellular response and consequently viral persistence in infected pigs, which would be of significant benefit to the virus. Different PRRSV isolates seem to have different abilities to induce or inhibit IFN-α (Lee et al., 2004) , and this difference may be attributed to the genetic diversity of PRRSV. Although several lines of evidence suggest that PRRSV possesses immunosuppressive properties (Done and Paton, 1995; Drew, 2000; Jung et al., 2009) , the mechanism for virulence and persistence of PRRSV is yet unclear. It is postulated that at least one of the mechanisms may be related to the modulation of type I IFN production by PRRSV."

699,804153,"Regarding viruses, for reasons probably partly identical involving alkalinisation by chloroquine of the phagolysosome, several studies have shown the effectiveness of this molecule, including against coronaviruses among which is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus [1 , 12 , 13] ( Table 1 ) . We previously emphasised interest in chloroquine for the treatment of viral infections in this journal [1] , predicting its use in viral infections lacking drugs. Following the discovery in China of the in vitro activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2, discovered during culture tests on Vero E6 cells with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC 50 and EC 90 values) of 1.13 μM and 6.90 μM, respectively (antiviral activity being observed when addition of this drug was carried out before or after viral infection of the cells) [3] , we awaited with great interest the clinical data [14] . The subsequent in vivo data were communicated following the first results of clinical trials by Chinese teams [4] and also aroused great enthusiasm among us. They showed that chloroquine could reduce the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia [4 , 6] , leading to recommend the administration of 500 mg of chloroquine twice a day in patients with mild, moderate and severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia. At such a dosage, a therapeutic concentration of chloroquine might be reached. With our experience on 20 0 0 dosages of hydroxychloroquine during the past 5 years in patients with long-term treatment ( > 1 year), we know that with a dosage of 600 mg/day we reach a concentration of 1 μg/mL [15] . The optimal dosage for SARS-CoV-2 is an issue that will need to be assessed in the coming days. For us, the activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably the same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of action of these two molecules is identical, and we are used to prescribe for long periods hydroxychloroquine, which would be therefore our first choice in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. For optimal treatment, it may be necessary to administer a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose. "
700,1902924,"In biopsy or autopsy studies, pulmonary pathology for both early 6 and late phase 7 COVID-19 patients showed diffuse alveolar damage with the formation of hyaline membranes, mononuclear cells, and macrophages infiltrating air spaces, and a diffuse thickening of the alveolar wall. Viral particles were observed in the bronchial and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells by electron microscopy. 8, 9 In addition, spleen atrophy, hilar lymph node necrosis, focal haemorrhage in the kidney, enlarged liver with inflammatory cell infiltration, oedema, and scattered degeneration of the neurons in the brain were present in some patients. 8, 9 SARS-CoV-2 infectious virus particles have been isolated from respiratory samples, 10 as well as from faecal 11 and urine (Zhao J, Guangzhou Medical University, personal communication) specimens from COVID-19 patients, suggesting that multiple organ dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients is at least partially caused by a direct attack from the virus. However, there are no reports about the post-mortem observations of the broad dissemin ation of the viral particles by autopsy right now. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can directly target organs other than the lung, especially those organs with high expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 12, 13 and organs with L-SIGN 14 as possible alternative cell receptors for SARS-CoV-2, has to be further investigated. In addition, the question of how the SARS-CoV-2 spreads to extrapulmonary organs remains an enigma. Genomic variation of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 has been obser ved, and the difference in the virulence needs further investigation. 15"
701,960569,"The acutely ill returned traveler is a common clinical scenario. Depending on destination, studies indicate that the prevalence of travelrelated illnesses among travelers can reach as high 80%. 1, 2 Furthermore, international travel has dramatically increased over the past decades, and international tourist arrivals alone reached 1.2 billion in 2015, with increased numbers of traveler to destinations outside of Europe and North America. 3 Recent economic and popular trends have also led to an expanding range of travelers beyond business travelers, tourists, and aid workers, including budget travelers, study abroad students, medical tourists, and travelers visiting friends and relatives (VFR). VFR travelers are those returning to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives, and as a group they tend to be at increased risk of severe travel-related infections. 4 The increase of international travel has also included those with special needs or medically complex travelers, including elderly, pediatric, pregnant, and immunocompromised travelers. 4, 5 While well-known tropical diseases such as malaria, dengue, and enteric fever (typhoid and paratyphoid fevers) continue to be encountered in travelers, itineraries outside of traditional destinations and novel exposures presents providers with an increasing range of infections. Emerging infections and outbreaks further expand the infectious possibilities, and several recent epidemics including Zika, Ebola virus disease (EVD), and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been notable for their rapid international spread. [6] [7] [8] Although the likelihood of a severe travel-related infection is relatively low compared to common ailments such as travelers' diarrhea (TD) and upper respiratory virus infections, their possibility presents a clinical problem that is particularly challenging in travel medicine (Fig. 1) . Travel-related infections typically present with nonspecific symptoms, and while the majority are not severe and even self-limiting, others can be of high-consequence and require urgent treatment or enhanced infection control. Relying on diagnostic intuition based on local clinical experience can therefore be dangerous in returned travelers. For example, while the common causes of fever in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients in North America are typically non-life threatening, febrile travelers who have returned from tropical areas may have malaria. High-consequence infections that should not be missed include malaria and other potentially clinically severe infections (e.g. enteric fever, dengue fever, leptospirosis, melioidosis, tick-borne infections, and rickettsial infections) and infections of major public health importance such as viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs), MERS, and anthrax. Nosocomial outbreaks of EVD in the U.S. and MERS in South Korea have demonstrated how these infections can present serious risk when unsuspected in healthcare settings. 6, 7 Furthermore, co-infections can occur and providers should consider this possibility, particularly when the patient is not responding appropriately to treatment of a confirmed infection, 9, 10 A key strategy when managing a returned sick traveler is to quickly assess the probability of infections so the diagnostic and treatment plan can be directed towards likely infections as well as the high-consequence infections that cannot be missed. The challenge for physicians in the primary care and emergency department setting can be daunting, and at minimum, identification of returned travelers and the possibility of unusual infections requiring consultation with specialists or health departments is becoming a critical role for frontline physicians. In this review key strategies in evaluating acutely sick returned travelers are addressed. "
702,175260,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia, believed to have originated in a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China at the end of 2019, has gained intense attention nationwide and globally. To lower the risk of further disease transmission, the authority in Wuhan suspended public transport indefinitely from Jan 23, 2020; similar measures were adopted soon in many other cities in China. As of Jan 25, 2020, 30 Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions covering over 1·3 billion people have initiated first-level responses to major public health emergencies. A range of measures has been urgently adopted, 1,2 such as early identification and isolation of suspected and diagnosed cases, contact tracing and monitoring, collection of clinical data and biological samples from patients, dissemination of regional and national diagnostic criteria and expert treatment consensus, establishment of isolation units and hospitals, and prompt provision of medical supplies and external expert teams to Hubei province."
703,1986829,"We have shown that epidemic curves and estimates for the effective reproduction number confirm the very different nature of the pH1N1 outbreaks in Victoria and WA. There appeared to be no pandemic virus in WA prior to multiple importations from Victoria, other Australian jurisdictions and overseas. Estimates of R in WA were consistently around 1.2 and never above 1.4. By contrast, initial estimates of R in Victoria approached 3, followed by a rapid -and implausible -decrease over a very short period of time. This precipitous fall cannot be explained satisfactorily by potential reduced transmission associated with early control interventions (such as partial school closure, t isolation and treatment of cases, and chemoprophylaxis and home quarantine of contacts), or depletion of susceptible people within the population. For instance, it took 20 days for the estimated value of R for the 1918-19 pandemic in San Francisco to fall from ,2.4 to ,1.2 [9] . We suggest the high initial value of R = 2.7 in the Victorian pandemic and the dramatic decline in 9 days is more likely explained by unrecognised cases due to an earlier commencement of the epidemic in Victoria."
704,3137408,"In the present study we investigated age related effects of inoculum size and cellular immunity on the CNS disease caused by JHM virus (JHMV) in Wistar Lewis (WL) rats . Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 10 5 pfu or less . The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance . However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV . The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats . Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile . The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent . From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system . When cellular immunity is suppressed or absent the disease process is altered from one in which white matter demyelination predominates to another form of disease in which neuronal involvement is prominent ."
705,1627317,"As new diagnostic techniques for respiratory pathogens became more widely available in research and clinical settings, co-detection of RSV with another respiratory virus is not uncommon. Studies have shown that co-detection of RSV with other respiratory viruses could account for 35%-40% of all RSV infections in young children [7] [8] [9] . However, the role of viral-coinfections remains unclear in the severity of RSV-associated respiratory diseases. Several systematic reviews suggest that there is no association between disease severity and viral co-infections (compared to mono-infections) but little was reported in these reviews regarding RSV-specific effects [10] [11] [12] [13] . Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand the role of viral-coinfections with RSV in the clinical severity in children <5y."
706,2377332,"Noninvasive ventilation has been increasingly used in the management of AHRF with variable success. [9] [10] [11] [12] While NIV may initially avoid the need for intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) , several studies have reported high failure rates and the need for invasive ventilation among patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and an association with increased mortality. 12 In a recent analysis from the LUNG SAFE study on unselected patients with ARDS, NIV was associated with higher intensive care unit (ICU) mortality in patients with the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) lower than 150 mm Hg. 12 The role of NIV in AHRF secondary to viral respiratory infections is unclear. Although some uncontrolled studies suggested that NIV was effective and safe in management of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [13] [14] [15] others have highlighted concern of increased transmission risk to healthcare workers when patients with SARS are treated with NIV. 16 Use of NIV in AHRF caused by pandemic H1N12009 virus (pdmH1N1) infection has been reported from several countries, [17] [18] [19] with reported NIV failure reaching up to 85%. 17 All studies were limited by their retrospective nature and, often, small sample size."
707,2034675,"Like other delta-CoVs, the PDCoV encodes two specific accessory genes namely NS6, located between the M and N genes, and NS7, occupied within the N gene [37] . Currently, the role of accessory proteins in the replication of delta-CoVs are not clearly elucidated. Here, we employed the reverse genetics to construct recombinant PDCoVs with abortive NS6 or NS7 genes and demonstrated that both NS6 and NS7 were not essential for PDCoV replication in vitro ( Figure 2C and D) . In addition, we showed, using rPDCoV-ΔNS7, that the NS7a, a newly identified accessory protein encoded by PDCoV [30] , is also not required for efficient replication in LLC-PK1 cells. However, it is important to emphasize that while rPDCoV-ΔNS7 with both NS7 and NS7a deletion exhibited similar growth kinetics with the parental virus in vitro, rPDCoV lacking the functional NS6 displayed markedly lower replication efficiency ( Figure 3B and C). These data thus suggested that PDCoV accessory protein NS6, but not NS7, is very like play a key role in promoting viral replication."

709,2643527,"Resilience is the ability to reduce the effect of a distressing event by anticipation and preparation or to ""bounce back"" once it has occurred. Two evidence-based approaches to individual resilience are particularly apt for pandemic preparation. Folkman and Greer's framework for maintaining psychological well-being during serious illness describes a sequence of appraisal and coping processes that are designed to recover positive emotions and effective adaptation. 19 They describe a sequential approach to coping that is experience-near for many healthcare workers: problem solving for events that are appraised to be within one's control, emotion-based coping to enhance support and reduce isolation, and meaning-based coping for events that are unresolved and cause persistent distress after problemfocused efforts. This framework facilitates flexibility, acknowledging that distress and coping are highly individual and depend on experience, values and expectations. It also facilitates discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to coping, and the evidence that coping through escape-avoidance and self-blame are maladaptive in healthcare workers responding to infectious disease. 14 The second approach that we advocate is psychological first aid, 20 an evidence-based approach to facilitating resilience immediately after trauma. Healthcare workers can learn psychological first aid without any prior mental health education. Furthermore, learning to support others may also enhance the resilience of the provider. As with Folkman and Greer's model, psychological first aid does not pathologize people who are stressed by extraordinary events. Rather, it assumes that those who are stressed are competent and are able to determine whether or not they wish or need assistance. It teaches a respectful approach to reducing distress through enhancing safety and comfort, helping survivors of trauma to identify their needs, providing information and facilitating social connection. 20"

713,1867784,"The invasion and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with the host immune response. The spike glycoprotein (S protein) on the viral envelop binds to its receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on the surface of human cells. 15, 23 An analysis of the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its binding affinity for ACE2 using cryogenic electron microscopy and sur face plasmon resonance showed that the structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein is very similar to that of SARS, although with minor differences. 28 The affinity of SARS-CoV-2 S protein binding to ACE2 is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the SARS S protein, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might transmit more readily from person to person. 28 Innate immunity is the first line of defence against virus invasion. Viral infection of mammals activates intracellular pattern recognition receptors that sense pathogenassociated molecular patterns, such as double-stranded RNA or uncapped mRNA. The recognition of pathogenassociated molecular patterns results in subsequent cytolytic immune responses, mainly through the type I interferons (IFN) and natural killer cells. Adaptive immunity also plays an important part in viral clearance via activated cytotoxic T cells that destroy virus-infected cells and antibody-producing B cells that target virusspecific antigens. Patients with COVID-19, especially those with severe pneumonia, are reported to have substantially lower lymphocyte counts and higher plasma concentrations of a number of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and tumor necro sis factor (TNF). 27, 29, 30 Another study 29 reported that CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells were reduced in severely ill patients compared with those with mild disease symptoms. Moreover, a substantial reduction of CD4+ T cell and CD8+ T cell counts in the peripheral blood was also observed in a patient who died. 7 Not ably, the proinflammatory subsets of T cells, including IL-17-producing CCR4+ CCR6+ CD4+ (T-helper 17 or Th17) cells and perforin and granulysin-expressing cytotoxic T cells were increased, which could be partly responsible for the severe immune injury in the lungs of this patient. 7 The anti-viral immune response is crucial to eliminate the invading virus, but a robust and persistent anti-viral immune response might also cause massive production of inflammatory cytokines and damage to host tissues. 31 The overproduction of cytokines caused by aberrant immune activation is known as a cytokine storm. In fact, in the late stages of coronavirus disease, including SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, cytokine storms are a major cause of disease progression and eventual death. 7,32, 33 Huang and colleagues 27 found increased plasma concentrations of both Th1 (eg, IL-1β and IFNγ) and Th2 (eg, IL-10) cytokines. Notably, patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) had higher plasma concentrations of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, granulocyte-colony stimulat ing factor, IFNγ-induced protein-10 (IP-10), macro phage chemo attractant protein-1, macro phage inflam matory pro tein 1α, and TNF compared to those not admitted to the ICU. Two other studies 29,34 also showed that plasma IL-6 concentrations were above the normal range in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 compared with healthy individuals and those with milder symptoms. Mehta and colleagues 35 suggest that secondary haemo phagocytic lymphohistio cytosis (sHLH) could be associated with severe COVID-19 cases. HLH is a disease entity characterised by an uncon trolled cytokine storm and expansion of tissue macrophages or histiocytes that exhibit haemophagocytic activity. 36 HLH can result from genetic defects in cytolytic pathways (familial or primary HLH) or other diseases such as infection, malignancy, and rheu matic disease (sHLH). 37 In 1952, Farquhar and Claireaux first described cytokine storm in patients with HLH. 38 The characteristics of HLH, including hypercyto kinaemia, unremitting fever, cyto penias, hyperferritin aemia, and multi-organ damage, are commonly seen in seriously ill patients with COVID-19. 27, 35 It is suggested that alveolar macrophages expressing ACE2 are the primary target cells for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These activated macrophages may play an important part in HLH-like cytokine storm during COVID-19. 39 Thus, early identification and appropriate treatment of this hyperinflammatory status is important for reducing the mortality of patients with COVID-19. 35"
714,2302082,"This study produced four main findings regarding LRI of viral origin in children in New Caledonia. First, molecular tools enabled us to detect newer viruses including hMPV, hCoV and hBoV, which had been previously described in respiratory infections but never before identified in our setting. Second, RSV infections were clearly seasonal and peaked at the beginning of the cool season, likely promoted by community life (the beginning of the school year). Third, the seasonal distribution of influenza in children appeared to be concordant with previous findings in adults, in which the majority of cases occurred between June and September [4] . However, our ability to assess flu seasonality was limited because the total number of influenza cases observed during our study period was surprisingly small and all were associated with viral types B and C. None of these cases was accompanied by a pneumococcal superinfection, which differs from other descriptions [4, 20] , but the absence of this infection may be due to our small numbers. This finding is important, as it emphasizes the value of long-term continuous surveillance to monitor trends in influenza and other respiratory viruses over time. Finally, hRhV was detected throughout the year and was as common in cases as in controls, calling into question its role as a LRI pathogen."

Three patients with no chest CT were also excluded (all excluded cases were proved uninfected later). Thus, the final cohort consisted of 21 patients. The following clinical information was extracted from patient' electronic medical records: age, gender, exposure history, the result of RT-PCR, the duration between the symptom onset and chest CT or RT-PCR, and the confirmed diagnosis."
716,2597172,"It is not yet known whether the SARS-CoV E protein ion channel activity has an important role in coronavirus replication. However, for the two best characterized virus ion channels -M2 protein from influenza A and Vpu from HIV-1ion channel activity has been strongly linked to roles in the virus's life cycles by studies with mutants and channel blocking drugs (Hout et al., 2005a (Hout et al., , 2005b Pinto et al., 1992; Sakaguchi et al., 1996; Schubert et al., 1996) . The M2 ion channel activity is inhibited by amantadine and some of its derivatives, and these are currently used in the clinical treatment of influenza A infections (Fleming, 2001; Pinto et al., 1992) . We have demonstrated that the Vpu ion channel activity in planar lipid bilayers is blocked by the amiloride derivate HMA, and that HMA also inhibits replication of HIV-1 in cultured human macrophages . For some other viral ion channels, inhibitors have also been discovered (Griffin et al., 2003; Pavlovic et al., 2003; Premkumar et al., 2005; Premkumar et al., 2004) , although evidence of antiviral activity of the compounds has not yet been published.

717,75892,"Respiratory virus infection is a major source of global pandemics as a consequence of swift human-to-human respiratory tract transmission. Within the past two decades, coronaviruses and influenza viruses have hit the world several times, causing significant mortality, economic loss, and global panic. The SARS outbreak in 2002 triggered 916 deaths among more than 8000 patients in 29 countries, followed by the emergence of MERS in 2012, which resulted in at least 800 deaths among 2254 patients in 27 countries. 2 Besides coronaviruses, avian and swine influenza remain a concern for global public health-in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic alone, there were 18 500 laboratory-confirmed deaths and more than 200 000 deaths from respiratory disease worldwide (based upon epidemiological modelling). 3 In late 2019, a cohort of patients presenting with pneumonia of varying acuity and unknown aetiology in Wuhan, China heralded the outset of COVID-19. As of 16 March 2020, a total of 167 511 confirmed cases (including 6606 deaths in 152 geographical territories) have been reported to the World Health Organization (Take home figure) , and this number is still increasing.

The sensitivity and specificity of both the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR RUO assay on clinical samples appears similar with 100% of concordance on 83 clinical nasopharyngeal samples. Thus, the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR RUO assay provides a promising commercial alternative for SARS-CoV-2 detection with a slightly better sensitivity than the WHO currently recommended assay. It can be used in most laboratories with various extraction and realtime PCR platforms. To date, RT-PCR assays remain the methods of choice for COVID-19 diagnosis even if it can lack of sensitivity in swab samples from some patients, mostly presenting late stage diseases and for which chest CT or other respiratory samples can be of valuable help [11] [12] [13] . This point also highlights the necessity of having highly sensitive PCR assays and the critical importance of checking and comparing their performances. If the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 assay will not fulfil all our needs, especially for high-throughput and highly automatized assays, it provides a robust, versatile and sensitive options for all molecular biology laboratories.

723,2676320,"Flavonoids are an important kind of natural products. In particular, they belong to a type of plant secondary metabolites with a polyphenolic structure widely found in fruits and vegetables. They have miscellaneous reciprocal biochemical and antioxidant effects associated with various diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis [25] [26] [27] . It is due to antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, anti-mutagens and anti-cancer-causing properties combined with the ability to control major cell enzyme functions 15 . Intriguingly, some flavonoids also have antiviral activity 17 . Specifically, apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, amentoflavone 28 , quercetin, daidzein, puerarin, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, gallocatechin gallate 29 and kaempferol 30 were reported to inhibit the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Therefore, the antiviral effect is presumed to be directly linked to suppress the activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in some cases. However, the systematic analysis using various scaffolds of flavonoids was not reported. In order to find the best scaffold to inhibit the function of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, an assay with various flavonoid derivatives classified in 10 scaffolds was built and performed. Among them, the best compounds were one flavonol, herbacetin and two flavones, rhoifolin and pectolinarin. In the current assay method including 0.01% Triton X-100, the three flavonoids showed the better inhibitory activity than the previously reported flavonoids as mentioned above [28] [29] [30] . The aggregating tendency of flavonoids frequently leads to obtain false bioassay results and can be avoided by adding 0.01% Triton X-100 24 .

Four patients required mechanical ventilation. 2 The second wave-since Jan 12, 2003, some complicated SARS cases from the neighbouring cities were transferred to the major hospitals in Guangzhou for better medical care. The index community SARS case of Guangzhou was a 46-year-old male seafood merchant who was admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University on Jan 31, 2003. He had travelled to Zhongshan in mid-January. The patient stayed in the hospital for only 18 h, but caused more than 30 hospital staff to become infected. On Feb 1, 2003, the Guangzhou index patient was transferred to the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan University. During the transfer, the ambulance driver, two doctors, and two nurses were infected. Within the next 8 days, 20 more medical staff who had been in contact with the patient became infected. At the same time, 19 family members or relatives of the patient fell ill with similar clinical manifestations after close personal contact with the patient. This patient generated a large cluster of secondary infections that further spread and gave rise to the outbreak in Guangzhou. In mid-February, one doctor working at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhongshan travelled to Hong Kong, and became the major source of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, which led on to the pandemic. 4 D e c 2 9 , 2 0 0 2 D e c 3 1 , 2 0 0 2 J a n 2 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 4 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 6 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 8 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 0 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 2 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 4 , 2 0 0 3 J a n 1 6 , 2 0 0 3 J a n All patients had high fever (>38°C) lasting for a mean of 11 days (SD 6·8), and developed pneumonia within 1-4 days of admission.

726,343465,"With the rare exception, it is likely that most infectious enteric agents of cattle co-evolved with their bovine hosts long before their domestication thousands of years ago [51, 52] . If an agent was able to survive under the free-range conditions of the wild bovine, it is likely that transmission occurs relatively easily in the environment of the intensively managed domesticated bovine of today. Indeed, these agents are shed by infected animals in numbers several logarithms higher per gram of feces than the total number required to infect the typical susceptible calf. Additionally, these agents have been shown to be extraordinarily flexible with regard to their genetic make-up and through survival of the fittest can rapidly take advantage of new environments and management systems. Consequently, intervention strategies devoted to a single control point may be successful in the short run but are likely to prove unsuccessful over the long run."

The model output (posterior) for time of introduction (the start of transmission) place this event a couple of days after the first confirmed case in the country, and over a month before the first confirmed death ( Figures  1E-F) . In both R 0 scenarios, by the time the first death was reported (05/03/2020), thousands of individuals (~0.08%) would have already been infected with the virus (as also suggested by [5] ). By 19/03/2020, approximately 36% (R 0 =2.25) and 40% (R 0 =2.75) of the population would have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Running the same model with R 0 =2.25 and the proportion of the population at risk of severe disease being distributed around 0.1%, places the start of transmission at 4 days prior to first case detection and 38 days before the first confirmed death and suggests that 68% would have been infected by 19/03/2020. The results of the same exercise for Italy ( Figure 2 ) place the time of introduction around 10 days before the first confirmed case, and around a month before the first confirmed death (Figures 2E-F) when the proportion of the population at risk of severe disease is around 1%.

732,25457,"MERS and SARS are known to cause adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, prematurity, fetal growth restriction and maternal death. 2 Experience of COVID-19 in pregnancy is limited. In one reported case, the pregnant woman required mechanical ventilation and a caesarean section at 30 weeks gestation. 3 Fetal distress and preterm delivery were reported in some other cases where infection occurred in the third trimester. 4 Intrauterine virus transmission from mother to baby before delivery is a recognised risk. 5, 6 Pregnant women with COVID-19 respiratory illness should be treated with priority because of the risk of complications. So far, there is no evidence that pregnant women are more susceptible to COVID-19 than the general population, 7 but pregnancy is nevertheless a risk factor for increased illness and death in outbreaks of influenza. 8 Systematic screening of suspected infection during pregnancy with extended follow-up of confirmed cases has been called for, 9 although the practicability of such measuresgiven often mild symptoms, lack of test kits and so onis uncertain. Pregnant women face special challenges because of their responsibilities in the workforce, as caregivers of children and other family members, and their requirements for regular contact with maternity services and clinical settings where risk of exposure to infection is higher. 8 Functioning, well-resourced health systems are undoubtedly needed to manage the situation effectively. The outbreak is already placing health services in developed countries under considerable strain. The recommendations for maternity services alone, to limit pregnant women's exposure to ill persons, while ensuring that women receive essential care, means identifying potential cases before entry at health service points, delaying routine appointments and using strict isolation and infection control measures to limit transmission to other patients and staff. 6 In low-resource health systems, putting these recommendations in place may not always be feasible. Dealing with COVID-19 is likely to create imbalances in health care provision, disruption of routine essential services and to require redeployment of scarce health personnel across health services."
733,2574535,"The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of small membrane proteins, which was induced by type I and II interferon and expressed broadly in tissues and cell lines [13] [14] [15] . IFITMs have diverse roles, including the control of cell proliferation, promotion of homotypic cell adhesion, protection against viral infection, promotion of bone matrix maturation and mineralization, and mediating germ cell development [16] . Recently, IFITMs were identified as broad-spectrum antiviral proteins by inhibiting the early step of virus infection, however different IFITMs has different antiviral activity [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, there is almost no species specificity in antiviral activity of IFITMs [22, 23] . For example, primate-derived IFITMs are effective inhibitors of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and primate IFITM3 alleles also exhibit superior anti-HIV activity compared to human IFITM3 [22, 24, 25] . Amino-terminal mutants of primate IFITM3 are more easily incorporated into HIV virions, resulting in enhanced inhibition of HIV-1 fusion [25] . Among the IFITMs, IFITM3 was widely studied for its wide range of effective antiviral activities, which could restrict Dengue virus, SARS coronavirus, Ebola virus, HCV, influenza A virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and so on [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . We also discovered that overexpression of human IFITM3 significantly restricted vaccinia virus infection, replication and proliferation, mainly by interfering with virus entry in a low pH-dependent manner [18] ."

737,3101674,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. A distinct coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS-CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS-CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations."

We refer to those infections causing few or no symptoms as subclinical. We assume older individuals are more likely to show clinical symptoms [11] .

By ET, the proliferating membranes are revealed to be a complex anastomosing system of membranes almost certainly derived from ER. In the Semliki Forest virus replicon system containing Kunjin virus proteins, expression of a single flavivirus protein, NS4A, can induce the membrane rearrangements [22] , and similar results have been reported for Dengue virus NS4A [57] , but it is uncertain at this time if this role can be assigned to NS4A in the TBFV. Future investigation is in progress to determine which TBFV protein or combination of proteins cause membrane rearrangement in mammalian and tick cells."
740,498942,"Laboratory factors may also influence the outcome of viral load. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, washes, swabs and brushes are usually considered suitable for RT-PCR analysis [33] . However, the sample size itself is difficult to quantify and some methods are more invasive than others. The quality and volume of nasal wash fluid and other samples (concentration of epithelial cells and/or leucocytes), may vary considerably. Most of the studies have not corrected for the amount of human DNA, epithelial cells or leucocyte counts in nasal wash specimen samples. This is also a limitation of our study. In an individual (adult) patient in our laboratory we found a 1000 fold difference in human DNA concentration between two broncho-alveolar lavage samples, taken by the same pulmonologist, potentially reflecting a similar difference in viral sample size (unpublished observation). Differences in the RT-PCR methods itself may influence sensitivity of the test too. The sensitivity of multiplex RT-PCRs is generally lower than that of single target PCRs [33] . The efficiency of the first step of the RT-PCR procedure, nucleic acid extraction, may vary between samples with different composition and nucleic acid concentrations. The efficiency of both steps may vary considerably between different target sequences. A given RNA or DNA concentration may result into different CT values depending on the target sequence, on the reverse-transcription and polymerase enzymes, and on the reaction conditions used. Furthermore, RNA viruses have a linear amplification step during the reverse transcription before the (exponential) PCR reaction. Therefore, the CT-value as such cannot be used to determine which virus is most important in multiple viral infections. In addition, interpretation of differences in viral load between RNA and DNA is complicated (Table 1) . Finally, cut-off values of CT in RT-PCR are also important. Karpinnen et al. found significant differences in the amount of virus between cases and controls, suggesting that cut-off levels for CT have to be defined in order to provide adequate interpretation of positive test results [34] . The cut off value for a positive RT-PCR test result of 45 in our study is probably too high."

For SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the S protein was shown to be the most important antigen leading to production of nAbs and inhibition of viral entry into the host cells (82) . Since then, S protein has been the major target for vaccine candidates.

Subunit vaccines targeting RBD specifically elicited high nAb titers but were not associated with immune enhancement (82, 85) ."
742,1618289,"Acute weather events as well as general seasonal patterns may affect disease transmission rates by altering pathogen viability and persistence in the environment as well as by influencing human behaviour and contact patterns. This study found that MERS-CoV, although a zoonotic disease, follows similar environmental transmission patterns to other non-zoonotic respiratory diseases with analogous modes of transmission such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Tamerius et al. [30] have shown that global trends of influenza broadly follow either a ""cold-dry"" or ""humid-rainy"" pattern, corresponding to temperate and tropical climates. Additionally, temperate climates tend to have a single annual peak and tropical climates have semi-annual peaks. They further demonstrate that for countries with an annual influenza peak such as Saudi Arabia, temperature and humidity can be predictive of those peaks, even at latitudes close to the equator. Respiratory syncytial virus also follows similar environmental conditions, with peak timing in the Arabian Peninsula from December to February, following the distribution of cases in the temperate northern hemisphere [12] . The influence of weather is further supported by experimental evidence, which has demonstrated that lower temperatures and lower relative humidity each favour influenza transmission [11] . Furthermore, coronaviruses have been shown to exhibit strong seasonal variation in natural hosts, and the theory that these fluctuations may increase risk of zoonotic transmission at certain times of the year has been discussed [16] . The results here demonstrate that colder, drier conditions may increase the risk of zoonotic transmission of MERS from dromedaries to humans."

745,2034676,"Although dispensable for viral replication, coronavirus accessory proteins usually play pivotal roles in viral infection and pathogenesis in vivo. Menachery et al. reported that deletion of ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 in MERS-CoV led to a significant attenuation of the virus in mice [38] . On the other hand, newborn piglets infected with TGEV lacking protein 7 expression developed a faster and more pronounced clinical disease compared with the parental virus [39] . In this study, piglets infected with rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP showed minimal clinical signs, with significantly lower viral RNA copy numbers in small intestines compared with wild-type virus. In contrast, piglets orally fed with rPDCoV-ΔNS7 exhibited clinical manifestations and pathological injury similar to those infected with the wild-type virus (Figures 4-6, Table 1 ). These results suggested that the NS6 protein is necessary for efficient viral replication in vivo, which may be attributable to the high pathogenicity of PDCoV. Recently, Fang et al. demonstrated that the PDCoV NS6 predominantly localize to the ER complex and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, which is the site of coronavirus assembly and packaging [29] , suggesting that NS6 may be involved in virus assembly. Moreover, PDCoV NS6 was identified as an inhibitor of IFN-β expression by interacting with RIG-I and MDA5 to impede their association with doublestranded RNA, thus disturbing RLR-mediated IFN-β signal pathway [40] . It is thus probable that the NS6 protein might contribute to PDCoV pathogenesis by, at least in part, regulating virus-host interaction. Given that rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP is highly attenuated in vivo, it could be considered a promising vaccine candidate for PDCoV. Although immunological profiles of pigs inoculated with rPDCoV-ΔNS6-GFP are still needed to fully support its applicability, our study here provides the basis for rational development of recombinant live attenuated PDCoV vaccines."

748,2255271,"A major question in SARS-CoV-induced pulmonary disease is why a small percentage of patients, particularly those who produce neutralizing antibody early, experience persistent inflammation, ARD, and eventually succumb, while other patients survive the inflammatory responses and clear the virus. We speculate that a possible underlying mechanism may be related to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection that occurs in some patients with early, sub-optimal antibody activity that cannot completely clear the virus, but instead leads to persistent viral replication and inflammation (Fig. 2) . ADE is a well-known virology phenomenon that has been demonstrated in the infections of multiple viruses such as dengue, flavivirus, and influenza virus (Halstead and O'Rourke 1977; Haslwanter et al. 2017; Ochiai et al. 1992; . ADE promotes viral cellular uptake of infectious virus-antibody complexes following their interaction with FcR or other receptors, leading to enhanced infection of target cells (Halstead and O'Rourke 1977; Haslwanter et al. 2017; Ochiai et al. 1992; .

750,817101,"Filtering of inhaled air to protect against influenza has often been regarded as a self-evident tenet of infection prevention philosophy. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was a significant spur to research in the field of influenza transmission and infection prevention; however, the evidence is still limited. 11 Although it is certain that influenza is transmitted from infected to susceptible people through contaminated exhaled air, the relative importance of droplet and aerosol spread is still debated. A review by Tellier presents evidence to support the role of aerosols in influenza transmission, at least over short distances. 12 If true, an important consequence of this may be the need for effective respiratory protection devices to provide defence against aerosols, not just droplets. In this case, surgical masks are not sufficient since they can only offer protection against droplets. Instead, aerosol-filtering respirators are necessary. However, respiratory protection alone may not be sufficient. 11 A study looking at the ability of facemasks alone, versus facemasks and eye protection combined, to prevent infection from aerosols of live attenuated influenza virus, concluded that trans-ocular transmission was a sufficient and effective route of infection and that eye protection is a necessary adjunct to respiratory protection. 13 Although this observation is significant, it must be remembered that direct splash or splatter contamination, rather than exposure to smaller and lighter respirable particles, remains a primary consideration in the assessment of the requirement for eye protection as a component of respiratory and facial protection."

754,2574815,"Several key immunologic findings emerged from the early work on TGEV vaccines (Saif, 1999; Saif et al., 2012) . Due to the impermeable placenta of sows, piglets are born agammaglobulinic and rely solely on colostrum and milk antibodies for passive immunity (Saif and Jackwood, 1990) . This leaves the newborn piglet highly susceptible to a plethora of infectious agents. In sows, IgG is dominant in colostrum and is transudated from sow serum (Klobasa et al., 1987) . Newborn piglets acquire colostral antibodies (mainly IgG) via nursing. These immunoglobulins are transported across the piglet's intestinal epithelium only within the first 24-48 h after birth. During the next 2-3 days, in the transition to milk, sIgA becomes dominant and persists in milk throughout lactation. Thus IgG antibodies absorbed from sow colostrum provide piglets with serum antibodies that reflect the specificities of those in sow serum and prevent systemic infections. In contrast the IgA antibodies dominant in milk and function to provide local passive protection to the piglet intestinal tract. The enigma was to delineate the origin of the IgA immunocytes in the mammary gland that secrete sIgA anti-bodies into the milk. This knowledge was critical to aid in the design of enteric vaccines to induce passive milk sIgA antibodies. Besides milk, sIgA is the dominant Ig at mucosal surfaces and in most mucosal secretions (Macpherson et al., 2008; Mantis et al., 2011) . Its resistance to proteolytic enzymes affords sIgA a high level of stability in the gastrointestinal tract. TGEV research has provided both a basic understanding of the concept of lactogenic immunity, as well as vaccination strategies for its induction in seronegative pregnant swine. The discovery by Bohl and Saif of the gut-mammary-sIgA axis (trafficking of IgA immunocytes from the gut to the mammary gland) in swine in 1972 was a forerunner for the concept of a common mucosal immune system Saif, 1999; Saif and Bohl, 1983; Saif et al., 1972; Weisz-Carrington et al., 1978) . It provided an explanation for why sows that were naturally infected or orally inoculated with live TGEV and recovered from the infection had high persisting levels of sIgA antibodies in milk that protected their piglets from TGE. However, sows systemically immunized with inactivated TGEV vaccines had mainly IgG antibodies in serum and colostrum that declined rapidly in milk and provided little lactogenic immunity to piglets. This discovery led to maternal vaccination strategies to induce mucosal passive immunity applicable to multiple species and multiple enteric pathogens, including PEDV."

758,287821,"To date, sequence-specific PCR is the most common approach for virus identification and quantification in diagnostic laboratories as it is highly sensitive, rapid, and cost effective. However, specific PCR requires prior knowledge of the virus sequence, and a separate assay needs to be designed for each individual virus or virus type. Recently, high-throughput or next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enabled metagenomicbased identification of viruses by sequencing random fragments of all genomes present in a clinical or environmental sample [1] [2] [3] . As viral metagenomics is virus-sequence independent, potentially any virus, cultivable or uncultivable, known or novel, can be readily detected and the method can be applied to all types of virus genomes, including single-stranded DNA and RNA. Several research studies have used this technology in recent years to explore the breadth of the virome in diverse biological and environmental samples including human and animal feces [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , blood [13, 14] , animal and human tissues [15] [16] [17] , and human respiratory tract secretions [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and highlighted the validity of the approach to detect rare and novel viruses."

However, different groups have reported major variations in the growth kinetics, maximum obtainable titer, and techniques for recovery of this virus from tissue culture (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983; Pedersen et al., 1984; Tekes et al., 2012 Tekes et al., , 2007 Thiel et al., 2014) . For example, maximal titers measured by determining the TCID 50 can range between > 10 3 (Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983) and 10 4 TCID 50 /mL (Takano et al., 2015) at 24-48 hpi, or measured by plaque assay between > 10 4 (36 hpi) (Tekes et al., 2012 (Tekes et al., , 2007 and > 10 7 pfu/mL (20 hpi) (This Report). This suggests either high variability in the Fcwf-4 cell lines used or co-adaptation between a particular virus and Fcwf-4 cell line used during laboratory cultivation. Indeed, we report significant differences in FIPV Black replication properties between an Fcwf-4 cell line that was newly purchased from the ATCC, and the Fcwf-4 cells that were established at Cornell University. The enhanced rate of FIPV Black virus growth and increased maximum titer (> 10 7 pfu/mL by 20 hpi) obtained from infected Fcwf-4 CU cells, however, may not be due to coadaptation with our particular strain of FIPV Black, as these cells also replicated both biotypes of type II viruses. Instead, the Fcwf-4 CU cells may be highly susceptible to FCoV infection in general and therefore may be particularly useful in generating highly-permissive cell types to isolate and grow clinical type I FCoVs. The increased virus infection of Fcwf-4 CU cells could be due to any number of cellular factors; however, it is tempting to speculate that the reduced IFN-responsiveness of the Fcwf-4 CU cells relative to the Fcwf-4 ATCC cells may significantly enhance infection in the former. Further, these Fcwf-4 CU cells may express a higher density of the yet unknown type I virus receptor (Cham et al., 2017; Dye et al., 2007) and therefore may be critical in identifying the receptor or other cellular characteristics that allow for enhanced type I virus replication."

762,1212227,"ORF1b, which resultingly syntheses two large replicase polyproteins namely pp1a and pp1ab as illustrated in Figure 3 . The formation of polyprotein, pp1ab, at the Cterminal domain involves a -1 ribosomal frameshift (RFS) into ORF1b near the 3 0 end of ORF1a. This is the principal regulatory mechanism that is responsible for downregulating the expression level of ORF1b-encoded proteins in contrast to ORF1a-encoded nonstructural proteins. Both polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) cleaved with the help of several internal proteases (TMPRSS2) (see Supplementary Material; Abbreviation), and resulted in the assembly of viral nonstructural proteins (nsps) in the form of RTC (de Wilde et al. 2017 ). The proteolytic cleavage of both polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) by internal ORF1a-encoded proteases fallouts in the 15 mature replicases proteins. These replicase proteins comprise several types of enzymes, including helicase (nsp 13), exoribonuclease (nsp 14), RNAdependent RNA polymerase (nsp 12), and RNA capmodifying methyltransferases (nsp 14 and 16) which helped in the enzymatic activities and functions, necessary for viral RNA synthesis and capping . Finally, after the replication and transcription, the viral genome is packed into nucleocapsids (enveloped from smooth endoplasm reticulum by budding) and ultimately leave the cell through the exocytic pathway (Ulasli et al. 2010; de Wilde et al. 2017 )."
763,365459,"Building on our laboratory's longstanding interest in understanding the factors that drive affinity and sequence selectivity in small molecule recognition of RNA, 33 we previously reported the use of an 11,325-member resin-bound dynamic combinatorial library 34 (designed based on the structure of DNA-binding, bisintercalating peptide antibiotics) to identify a compound (1) able to bind the HIV-1 FSS upper stem-loop with moderate affinity (K D = 4.1 ± 2.4 μM immobilized on an surface plasmon resonance (SPR) chip via one of its amine groups; K D = 350 ± 110 nM in solution as measured by fluorescence 35 ) and good selectivity. 36 Subsequent efforts revealed that replacement of the disulfide bridge with an olefin (to produce compounds 2 and 3) could be accomplished without any reduction in affinity. These studies also indicated that affinity was essentially abolished if the π-surface area of the molecule was reduced, while the peptidic portion of 1 was required for sequence-selective binding. 35 (Right) HTLV-2 FSS stem-loop sequence used as a specificity control in this work. Note that when the slippery sequence occupies the decoding site of the ribosome, the lower stem is unwound and it is the upper stem-loop that acts as the effective frameshift stimulatory signal. While the binding ability of 2 and 3 was intriguing, subsequent preliminary experiments indicated the compounds were unable to inhibit virus in a pseudotyped HIV-1 assay (data not shown). Given these results, we hypothesized that further increases in affinity were essential. We anticipated that increasing the π surface area of 1 could represent a viable strategy for enhancing the affinity for the HIV-1 FSS without significant reductions in selectivity. In particular, incorporation of a benzo[g]quinoline moiety to produce 4 and 5 was viewed as attractive. This hypothesis was supported in part by parallel efforts in our laboratory on the design and synthesis of compounds targeting CUG repeat RNA in which incorporation of a benzo[g]quinoline was found to enhance affinity and to provide compounds with activity in vivo in a mouse model of Type 1 Myotonic Dystrophy. 37 Synthesis of 4 and 5 proceeded via cross-metathesis of half-structure 6, by analogy to our previous work. We also synthesized 7 and 8 (""one-armed"" benzo[g]quinoline-bearing structures), as well as compounds 9 and 10, to test the effect of sequential removal of the putative intercalators. Compound 11 was synthesized in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the olefin bioisostere in improving cellular availability and bioactivity relative to an easily reduced disulfide."
764,3060159,"We conducted a two-phase controlled clinical study on healthy pregnant women between 27 to 32 weeks gestation. In phase I, energy expenditure corresponding to the workload of routine nursing tasks was determined. In phase II, pulmonary function of 20 subjects was measured whilst at rest and exercising to the predetermined workload while breathing ambient air first, then breathing through N95-mask materials. Results: Exercising at 3 MET while breathing through N95-mask materials reduced mean tidal volume (TV) by 23.0 % (95 % CI −33.5 % to −10.5 %, p < 0.001) and lowered minute ventilation (VE) by 25.8 % (95 % CI −34.2 % to −15.8 %, p < 0.001), with no significant change in breathing frequency compared to breathing ambient air. Volumes of oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) and carbon dioxide expired (VCO 2 ) were also significantly reduced; VO 2 by 13.8 % (95 % CI −24.2 % to −3 %, p = 0.013) and VCO 2 by 17.7 %, (95 % CI −28.1 % to −8.6 %, p = 0.001). Although no changes in the inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were demonstrated, breathing through N95-mask materials during low intensity work (3 MET) reduced expired oxygen concentration by 3.2 % (95 % CI: −4.1 % to −2.2 %, p < 0.001), and increased expired carbon dioxide by 8.9 % (95 % CI: 6.9 % to 13.1 %; p <0.001) suggesting an increase in metabolism.

765,262,"HAI also known as nosocomial infection is a great concern in Nepal though it is said to be improving with time (between 2003 and 2011) at some hospitals [87] . However, infection control committee (ICC) was established in 41.2% (7/17) of the hospitals and of them regular ICC meeting was held in only two hospitals; ICC's operational activities were far from adequate [87] . Accordingly, none of the hospitals studied had an infection control team (ICT). Common HAI causing bacteria in Nepal includes Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., and others. Most of these HAI bacterial isolates are MDR. These bacteria are mainly associated with urinary tract infection, ventilator-associated pneumonia, surgical site and implant-associated infection, catheter site infection, and soft tissue infections. This is primarily due to high microbial (bacteria and fungi) burden in hospital environment and high pathogen career rate among staffs (hands: 59.2% and nose: 73.7%) mainly S. aureus and most of them were highly drug resistant) [88] ."
766,83458,"Dear Editor, Africa, despite having the world's greatest infectious disease burden, has a weak epidemiological surveillance system. Even in Europe, with its more advanced information systems, the official data on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are controversial due to poor standardisation. The data on COVID-19 in several African countries are currently scarce and uncertain, which does not allow for an objective analysis of the present situation. Some evidence also shows that several African countries exert tight control over public data and information. The WHO recently rebuked the Taznanian government for refusing to share information on alleged Ebola cases, the country denying the existence of any such cases. 1 Furthermore, it is not uncommon for journalists disclosing information on COVID-19 to be subject to intimidation by public authorities. 2 Interpretation of the pandemic's trend in Africa should consider three major factors: the undernotification of cases, the slower development of the epidemic, and a comparatively lower incidence to other continents. Previous epidemics were subject to catastrophic predictions (the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s-90s, the more recent Ebola epidemic), predictions which did not eventually occur. Therefore, caution should be exercised in regards to the extremely negative predictions of the present pandemic."

Anti-rdiotypic antibodies of the P-type (i.e., internal image), specific for this MAb, could induce protection against coronaviruses of the three species. The three structural proteins of different isolates of TGEV and PRCV are highly conserved (Fig. l) , indicating that PRCV, which was detected for the first time in 1984 (Pensaert et a/., 1986) could be derived from TGEV. Nevertheless, PRCV showed major antigenic differences in sites 6 and C of S peplomer protein (Fig.  1) and could derive by recombination between TGEV and other porcine (PEDV or HEV), feline (FIPV or FECV), or canine (CCV) coronaviruses, which would provide the modified antigenic sites B and C. This hypothesis is favored, versus the accumulation of point mutations, as two antigenic sites are different among these viral strains and mechanisms of genetic recombination have been demonstrated in coronavirus (Makino et al., 1986) . The most likely candidates among the coronaviruses, which could provide the new sites B and C to the respiratory variants of TGEV, should infect the same cells asTGEV, i.e., PEDV, CCV, and FIPV (Woods et al., 1981) . The production of PRCV variants by dele-tion in sites B, C, and D could also be the generation mechanism of the PRCV variants."
768,1271833,"In literature conflicting results are reported regarding multiple viral co-infections and its association with the severity of acute disease. In this study, 66.6% of the HRV positive patients HRV was co-detected with another virus compared to 42% of the RSV cases. In addition, most samples with more than 1 virus, HRV and RSV were detected together, in 12 (25.5%) of the 47 samples, respectively. Similar to our data, Aberle et al. [17] found HRV and RSV together in 35.9% of the dual infections and Advani et al. [24] found that in 73% of the coinfections HRV was involved. On the other hand, Greer et al. [25] found HRV in a much lower co-detection rate of 23.6%. Some studies have demonstrated that multiple viral pathogens cause more severe disease [1, 17] , whereas others did not find any difference in disease severity between the detection of a single and multiple respiratory viruses in respiratory samples, not even with the combination of RSV and HRV [16, 19, 26] . The present findings support the latter conclusion. We found that patients with multiple respiratory viruses even had a shorter duration of hospitalization and were more likely to have non-respiratory symptoms as diarrhea, vomiting and feeding problems. This is similar to the observation of a shorter duration of hospitalization in patients with RSV/HRV dual infections compared to those with a single infection with RSV by others [19, 27] . This suggests that HRV may have a potential protective effect on disease severity. This may be explained by the possible protection of the induced immune response trigged by viral infection from infection with a second virus as postulated by Greer et al. [25] where HRV could protect its host from infection by other viruses."
769,3044952,"Background: Neonatal diarrhoea is a frequent clinical condition in commercial swine herds, previously regarded to be uncomplicated to treat. However, since 2008 it seems that a new neonatal diarrhoeic syndrome unresponsive to antibiotics and common management practices has emerged. Routine laboratory examinations have not detected any pathogen related to this syndrome. The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate if well-known enteric pathogens could be associated with outbreaks of neonatal diarrhoea, thus question the hypotheses of a new syndrome. Furthermore, we wanted to evaluate macroscopic and microscopic findings associated with these outbreaks and if possible propose a preliminary piglet-level case-definition on syndrome New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea syndrome (NNPDS). Results: Four well-managed herds experiencing neonatal diarrhoea with no previously established laboratory conclusion and suspected to suffer from New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome, were selected. Within these herds, 51 diarrhoeic and 50 non-diarrhoeic piglets at the age of three to seven days were necropsied and subjected to histological and microbiological examination. Faeces were non-haemorrhagic. Neither enterotoxigenic E. coli, Clostridium perfringens type A or C, Clostridium difficile, rotavirus, coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp, Giardia spp, Cystoisospora suis nor Strongyloides ransomi were associated with diarrhoea in the investigated outbreaks. Macroscopically, the diarrhoeic piglets were characterized by filled stomachs and flaccid intestines without mucosal changes. The predominant histological lesions were villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum. Epithelial lesions in colon were seen in one third of the case piglets."
770,653816,"Most adults or children with 2019-nCoV infection presented with mild flu-like symptoms, although patients with severe illness could rapidly develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, and multiple organ failure, and deaths have been reported in some cases. 3 Most patients with pneumonia had abnormal chest radiography findings, such as bilateral ground-glass opacity, multiple lobular, and subsegmental areas of consolidation; 4 those with acute respiratory distress syndrome could show bilateral complete opacification of the lungs on CT scans. 1 Routine blood work was mostly unremarkable. 4 The nucleic acid test from respiratory tract samples or serum is effective in detecting the virus, and results are usually available within 4-6 h. 5 Neonates might get 2019-nCoV infection through close contact with virus-infected patients or virus carriers. In the case of neonatal infection, the disease might have insidious onset and be non-specific. 6 The diagnosis of 2019-nCoV neonatal infection should meet all the following requirements: (1) showing at least one of the clinical symptoms, including temperature instability, hypoactivity or poor feeding, or tachypnoea; (2) showing abnormal findings on chest radiograph, including unilateral or bilateral ground-glass opacity, multiple lobular, or subsegmental areas of consolidation; • Standard precautions include signage at the entrance, strict hand and respiratory hygiene, daily cleaning and disinfection of the environment, and provision of gloves, mask, and goggles for all medical staff • Additional enhanced contact precautions and respiratory droplet precautions include patients' own dedicated equipment, limited parents' visits, gown and glove change after procedures, and opening window regularly to change air • Avoid breastfeeding from mothers with probable or laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection until the recovery of confirmed mothers or rejection of probable infection • Medical waste generated during medical service should be collected into a double-layer infectious waste bag, which should be treated with chlorine-containing preparation for at least 10 min, then disposed of in the same way as infectious medical waste • Terminal disinfection of the patient's room is preferentially done using hydrogen peroxide atomisation or a chlorine-containing preparation spray work and chest radiography, and initialisation of respiratory support if necessary. The efficacy of antiviral drugs against 2019-nCoV is not certain. 7 Antimicrobial drugs are only prescribed to patients with probable or confirmed bacterial infection; empirical use or overuse should be avoided. For neonates with acute respiratory distress syndrome manifested by complete opacification of lungs, high-dose pulmonary surfactant replacement, nitric oxide inhalation, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation might be effective. Intravenous glucocorticoids or immunoglobulin could be tried in some difficult cases. Neonates with intracranial infection and convulsion should be handled according to corresponding guidelines. In critically ill neonates, continuous renal replacement and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could be implemented if necessary. Those who have no fever for at least 3 days and improved respiratory symptoms; resolution of previously abnormal chest radiography findings; and a series of two nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs negative for 2019-nCoV at least 48 h apart could be discharged home. All neonates newly admitted to the NICU need to be screened for high risk of 2019-nCoV infection (panel). Neonates at high risk, as assessed by family history, should be isolated in a single room for at least 14 days. If a neonate develops manifestations similar to 2019-nCoV infection during the isolation period or is highly suspected of 2019-nCoV infection on admission, the patient should be immediately referred to a designated hospital or a designated unit for 2019-nCoV infection. The patient's room cannot be used by other patients before being adequately disinfected. If this patient shared a room with other neonates before being identified, all wardmates should be isolated. Isolation must last at least 14 days, unless 2019-nCoV infection is ruled out."
771,1224467,"This study was performed using a relatively large panel of serum samples collected from health care workers from a Vietnamese hospital. We developed a recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein-based IgG ELISA and confirmed that the ELISA had a higher than 90% sensitivity and specificity in detecting IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV compared with neutralizing antibody assay, the gold standard method, and with the authentic SARS-CoV Ag-based IgG ELISA (Fig. 2) . There was a positive correlation between the OD 405 values in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA and the neutralizing antibody titers (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, sequential change in OD 405 in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA and neutralizing antibody titers in 19 subjects, in whom sero-conversion was demonstrated, was evaluated (Fig. 3) . Four of the 19 had already had antibody to SARS-CoV rNP detectable by SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA, although at this stage they had not yet had a neutralizing antibody equal to or over 20. On the other hand, only one serum sample that showed a positive reaction in neutralizing antibody assay at a titer of 20 showed a negative reaction in the SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA (Fig. 3) . These results suggest that this SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is as sensitive as the neutralizing antibody assay. Therefore, it can be concluded that the newly developed SARS-CoV rNP-based IgG ELISA is useful for the serological diagnosis of and seroepidemiological study on SARS-CoV infections."

773,3113928,"We review and introduce a generalized reaction-diffusion approach to epidemic spreading in a metapopulation modeled as a complex network. The metapopulation consists of susceptible and infected individuals that are grouped in subpopulations symbolising cities and villages that are coupled by human travel in a transportation network. By analytic methods and numerical simulations we calculate the fraction of infected people in the metaopoluation in the long time limit, as well as the relevant parameters characterising the epidemic threshold that separates an epidemic from a non-epidemic phase. Within this model, we investigate the effect of a heterogeneous network topology and a heterogeneous subpopulation size distribution. Such a system is suited for epidemic modeling where small villages and big cities exist simultaneously in the metapopulation. We find that the heterogeneous conditions cause the epidemic threshold to be a non-trivial function of the reaction rates (local parameters), the network's topology (global parameters) and the cross-over population size that separates ""village dynamics"" from ""city dynamics""."
774,2106924,"This review has identified diagnostics currently available for MERS-CoV and highlighted ongoing challenges caused by critical gaps in diagnostics to support outbreak management. RDTs offer the potential for rapid POC screening for MERS-CoV; however, there are practical limits to implementing lower respiratory sample acquisition outside of a hospital setting, limiting feasibility. POC or near-POC NAAT platforms provide an opportunity for implementation of automated, self-contained BMJ Global Health testing in hospitals and clinics with limited training in endemic-prone areas. Expansion of test menu options for existing POC or near-POC NAAT platforms will strengthen incountry response capacity to endemic diseases and simultaneously ensure countries are prepared for future pandemics. Syndromic multiplex panels may expedite differential diagnosis of MERS-CoV from other endemic respiratory diseases, but further analysis is needed to inform implementation and cost-effectiveness in the context of regional and seasonal detection. There is also a need for more sensitive serological assays with lower cost and minimum cross-reactivity that can be used as surveillance tools."

Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients (up to one-fourth of patients in some instances) with severe COVID-19 can have myocardial dysfunction or myocarditis [16, 17] . Anecdotal reports suggest benefit with intravenous immunoglobulin with resolution of myocarditis and recovery of cardiogenic shock by 3 weeks [18] . Similarly, patients with COVID-19 have been found to have elevated D-dimer levels and may be at greater risk of venous thromboembolism, although this needs to be prospectively studied and validated in the future [16, 17] . Table 1 summarizes the manifestations associated with COVID-19 which may mimic rheumatic syndromes. Various drugs are being investigated for their potential utility in COVID-19. Improved understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating infection with this virus and the subsequent immune responses can pave the way for empirical approaches and trials at this stage."
778,2601991,"Are 3c-like proteins a general feature of coronaviruses? On the basis of currently available information, this seems likely. Messenger RNA 4 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is known to encode a 15K polypeptide, the predicted amino acid sequence of which contains a highly hydrophobic region from residues 8 to 41 (9, 22) , although the protein has not so far been found in virions. Wesley and Woods (29) have identified a 17K polypeptide in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV)-infected cells, which could be a minor viral structural protein. intriguingly, sequence data deduced from the genomic RNA of several species of coronaviruses have indicated that the ORF immediately upstream of the membrane protein gene, in the equivalent position to that of 3c, has the potential to encode a hydrophobic protein with similar characteristics."

Available data suggest that the 2019-nCoV may be less pathogenic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (Table 2 ). However, the severity of the disease is not necessarily linked to its transmission efficiency and pandemic potential. 5 A rapidly increasing number of 2019-nCoV-infected cases suggests that this virus may be transmitted effectively among humans, and mild illness may be quite common in infected individuals. 1,2,5,6 These two features confer a high pandemic potential to the 2019-nCoV ( Table 2) ."

Many clusters of genes regulated by S. suis or PRRSV alone were also regulated in co-infected cells (Fig 4A) .

A novel clade 2c betacoronavirus, termed Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, was recently identified as the causative agent of a severe respiratory disease that is mainly affecting humans on the Arabian Peninsula (1) . Extending on previous work (2), we described European Pipistrellus bat-derived CoVs that are closely related to MERS-CoV (3) .

785,1920252,"The evolution of a new pandemic strain of influenza will inevitably result in a major increase in demand for critical care services. It is likely that these services will rapidly reach their capacity and even their contingency arrangements for extended facilities will be overwhelmed. Excessive demand where resources are finite creates an ethical dilemma and many emergency plans apply a utilitarian approach of 'best care for the greatest number' [29] . There is a legitimate debate about how limited capacity can best be utilised, but a number of themes are recurrent. There needs to be a legal and ethical framework for the process decided in advance, the rationale for triage should be fair and transparent and it should meet the principles of distributive justice [30] [31] [32] . Triage can conflict with human rights legislation and even humanitarian laws but 'accountability for reasonableness' can temper the disagreements about priority setting [33] ."
786,3088494,"Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is an economically significant cause of calf scours and winter dysentery of adult cattle, and may induce respiratory tract infections in cattle of all ages. Early diagnosis of BCoV helps to diminish its burden on the dairy and beef industry. Real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of BCoV has been described, but it is relatively expensive, requires well-equipped laboratories and is not suitable for on-site screening. A novel assay, using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA), for the detection of BCoV is developed. The BCoV RT-RPA was rapid (10-20 min) and has an analytical sensitivity of 19 molecules. No cross-reactivity with other viruses causing bovine gastrointestinal and/or respiratory infections was observed. The assay performance on clinical samples was validated by testing 16 fecal and 14 nasal swab specimens and compared to real-time RT-PCR. Both assays provided comparable results. The RT-RPA assay was significantly more rapid than the real-time RT-PCR assay. The BCoV RT-RPA constitutes a suitable accurate, sensitive and rapid alternative to the common measures used for BCoV diagnosis. In addition, the use of a portable fluorescence reading device extends its application potential to use in the field and point-of-care diagnosis."
787,921571,"Coinfections can be the result of multiple viruses, bacteria, or a combination of viruses and bacteria infecting the pig at the same time or in close succession. Numerous examples of coinfections with common swine viruses such as PRRSV, SwIV, porcine circovirus (PCV), and PRCV have been detected in the diagnostic lab and investigated experimentally, and coinfections with these viruses generally result in a more severe clinical disease outcome [115] [116] [117] [118] . Similarly, coinfections with the viruses mentioned above and common swine bacterial pathogens have often shown that these viruses are potent initiators of secondary bacterial infections [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Primary bacterial pathogens can also predispose to secondary bacterial colonisation and disease. Common examples of this in swine are enzootic pneumonia, where M. hyopneumoniae predisposes to secondary pneumonia with P. multocida, and atrophic rhinitis, where B. bronchiseptica predisposes to secondary infection with toxigenic strains of P. multocida [119] [120] [121] . Our lab has also demonstrated that B. bronchiseptica can increase colonisation with other bacteria such as G. parasuis [122] . Coinfections are not limited to only two pathogens and can be complicated in nature. For example, we have shown that PRRSV alone predisposes pigs to pneumonia with B. bronchiseptica but not with P. multocida whereas B. bronchiseptica can predispose to nasal colonisation with P. multocida [34] . However, if the pig is infected with both PRRSV and B. bronchiseptica, this can lead to pneumonia with P. multocida as well [123] ."

789,453772,"The PDCoV-challenged piglets exhibited clinical signs including diarrheic feces and lethargy by 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) and then displayed vomiting and diarrhea for 3 days. All inoculated animals were positive for PDCoV, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, at 1 or 2 dpi, and they shed PDCoV in feces. Peak mean Ct values of 16.8 (range, 16.7-16.8) and 18.7 (range, 18.5-18.9) were obtained at 3 to 4 dpi. The negative control pig remained active with normal feces and no fecal shedding of PDCoV detected throughout the study period. Two animals were independently euthanatized at 3 and 5 dpi for postmortem assessments, whereas the remaining piglets were necropsied at 35 dpi. Unlike the negative control piglet, all challenged piglets exhibited typical PDCoV-like macroscopic observations with thin and transparent small intestine walls (panel A in Fig. 2) . The inoculated pigs also developed histopathological intestinal lesions associated with viral enteritis, including shortened and fused villi in the small intestine (panels B and C in Fig. 2) . Furthermore, an immunohistochemistry assay detected PDCoV in the cytoplasm of villous enterocytes throughout the small intestines (panel D in Fig. 2) . These macroscopic and microscopic observations are consistent with previous studies using USA PDCoV isolates [1, 5] . Taken together, the results show that experimental infection of newborn piglets with PDCoV KNU16-07 induces clinical disease signs corresponding to acute enteritis, indicating enteropathogenicity of the isolate in the natural host. Additionally, all inoculated pigs had detectable PDCoV-specific neutralizing antibody (NA) by 14 dpi and maintained high NA titers of 1:128 to 1:256 thereafter, demonstrating the ability of KNU16-07 to induce efficient immune responses."

791,186694,"Some of the fabric materials tested in this study had relatively better filtration performance than others. For example, the Hanes sweatshirt showed less penetration levels against polydisperse aerosols at 5.5 cm s À1 face velocity compared to other fabric materials. Similarly, monodisperse aerosol penetration values for particles ,60 nm size were less for Hanes sweatshirt. However, the penetration values for .60 nm size particles were higher similar to the penetrations for other sweatshirts and the reason for the discrepancy is not clear. The filtration performance of the towels (Aquis, Pinzon, and Pem America) and one scarf (Walmart) against ,100 nm size monodisperse aerosol particles was relatively better than the other fabric materials. Moreover, filtration performance of the fabric materials showed no correlation with the airflow resistance levels. Filtration of polydisperse aerosol particles was effective by 100% cotton fabrics in one case, while 100% polyester, 100% cotton, or cotton/polyester combination was better for nanoparticle (,100 nm) range. Filtration performance of the fabric material cannot be estimated a priori from material composition because it is mostly dependent on fiber characteristics, including diameter, charge, and packing density. Moreover, the finished fabric products do not carry information on fiber properties involved in particle filtration. Thus, the selection process for a better performing improvised fabric material may be difficult for a common user. In spite of the poor performance, fabric materials may provide some level of protection against the transmission of infectious aerosols when used in combination with other protective measures. Recently, a review paper analyzed the data obtained from seven case-control studies on the intervention measures of SARS transmission (Jefferson et al., 2009) . The authors concluded that a combination of several measures including the use of respiratory protection devices, gloves, and other hygienic practices may reduce the spread of infectious diseases considerably than by a single method. Moreover, cloth masks and fabric materials covering the mouth and nose may serve as a reminder to not touch those areas with the hands serving to minimize contact transmission and reduce exposure to liquid splashes and droplets, although these premises would need to be confirmed experimentally."

793,1302587,"We determined that it was feasible to produce vaccine-relevant HIV-1 subtype C Gag-derived proteins in plants of Nicotiana spp. by means of transient expression via recombinant A tumefaciens, rather than via rTMV or transgenic expression. We demonstrated the positive effects on protein yield of plant codon optimisation, specific intracellular targeting, and protein composition. In particular, a p17/p24 fusion protein accumulated to relatively high levels in chloroplasts, was relatively easily partially purified from plants, and could be used to significantly boost both cellular and humoral immune responses in mice previously injected with an HIV DNA vaccine. This is the most vaccine-relevant HIV protein so far expressed in plants, and could have considerable potential."
794,3045730,"Genome sequence analysis of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) variants from patient specimens has revealed the evolutionary dynamics and mechanisms of pathogenesis of the virus. However, most studies have analyzed the consensus sequences of MERS-CoVs, precluding an investigation of intrapatient heterogeneity. Here, we analyzed non-consensus sequences to characterize intrapatient heterogeneity in cases associated with the 2015 outbreak of MERS in South Korea. Deepsequencing analysis of MERS-CoV genomes performed on specimens from eight patients revealed significant intrapatient variation; therefore, sequence heterogeneity was further analyzed using targeted deep sequencing. A total of 35 specimens from 24 patients (including a super-spreader) were sequenced to detect and analyze variants displaying intrapatient heterogeneity. Based on the analysis of non-consensus sequences, we demonstrated the intrapatient heterogeneity of MERS-CoVs, with the highest level in the super-spreader specimen. The heterogeneity could be transmitted in a close association with variation in the consensus sequences, suggesting the occurrence of multiple MERS-CoV infections. Analysis of intrapatient heterogeneity revealed a relationship between D510G and I529T mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike glycoprotein. These two mutations have been reported to reduce the affinity of the RBD for human CD26. Notably, although the frequency of both D510G and I529T varied greatly among specimens, the combined frequency of the single mutants was consistently high (87.7% ± 1.9% on average). Concurrently, the frequency of occurrence of the wild type at the two positions was only 6.5% ± 1.7% on average, supporting the hypothesis that selection pressure exerted by the host immune response played a critical role in shaping genetic variants and their interaction in human MERS-CoVs during the outbreak."
795,221,"All currently published studies are consistent with regard to the effect of PP on oxygenation during VV-ECMO. Clearly, PP improves oxygenation in a majority of patients. Moreover, previous studies mainly studied the effects of PP when performed late after VV-ECMO initiation (8 days in the Guervilly et al. study). It appears that for some patients PP was effective under ECMO and ineffective prior to ECMO. It is likely that time is an important factor in allowing lung healing and symptomatic treatments such as antibiotics to be effective. The decrease in lung aggression secondary to ultraprotective ventilation should also be considered."
796,862359,"Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses are the most frequently identified causes of the ""common cold"" syndrome [1] [2] [3] . Rhinoviruses are members of the Picornaviridae family and were first identified in 1956 [4] . Since then, 1100 different serotypes have been identified [5] . Human coronaviruses, members of the Coronaviridae family, were first identified in 1962 and have been particularly difficult to isolate by use of standard cell culture techniques [6, 7] . A self-limited upper respiratory tract illness, or ""common cold"" syndrome, is the usual clinical manifestation of infection with these viruses. However, over the past 3 decades, several studies have found these viruses to be associated with clinical syndromes that require hospital care [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] .

798,920386,"With the introduction of molecular techniques, the detection of multiple co-infecting viruses has become common [21] , though the prevalence of each virus varies between studies. Our results show that viral co-infection is frequent, particularly in children above one year of age: children aged 12-24 months had the highest number of detected viruses, which may reflect slower clearance (and perhaps increased pathogenicity) following primary infection by a virus, and an immature immune system [3, 22] . We observed that co-infection rates were lower in older children in both cohorts, despite this group being prone to greater LT-ARI exposure through increased participation in shared childcare groups. This finding is inconsistent with two previous reports. In particular, Chorazy et al. [23] reported a non-significant increase in co-infection in children aged 6-12 months, and co-infection decreased after one year with increasing age. Peng et al. [24] reported that co-infection was more frequent in children between 3-6 years of age."

801,1305032,"To the Editor-We appreciate the letters from Tso et al. [1, 2] that expand on our study [3] of the serologic profile of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). On the basis of the findings of our study, we are certain that IgG antibody persists for at least 60 days after the onset of symptoms. This is consistent with Tso et al.'s results, which, despite the different assays used, indicate that SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS CoV) immunoglobulin titers continue to increase from 15 days to 3 months after the onset of symptoms. Interestingly, the rate of seroconversion differs in the 2 studies, with an 83% rate of seroconversion reported in our study and a 100% rate of seroconversion reported in Tso et al.'s study [2] . This may have been a consequence of the different populations of patients and of the different assays used in the studies. Tso et al. selected 62 survivors from a group of 267 patients with SARS, among whom 78% had a 4-fold increase in SARS CoV immunoglobulin or a single titer of у100 during their first 3 months of follow-up [2, 4] . This 78% rate of seroconversion in the 267 patients [4] was close to our observations of 75% on day 21 and 83% on day 60. According to several reports, the immunofluorescent assay used by Tso et al. is more sensitive than the ELISA used in our study [5] [6] [7] . Nevertheless, ELISA provides similar results and remains the most convenient and reliable test in both clinical practice and epidemiologic studies."
802,2329899,"In fall 2009, in light of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Children's Hospital of Michigan (CHM) instituted a policy requiring combined contact (gown and glove) and droplet (mask) isolation precautions for all inpatients with URI symptoms. Determination of appropriate isolation precautions for hospitalized pediatric patients with potential respiratory coinfection is an important intervention to prevent health care-associated infections (HAI). 10 Cohorting of patients with clinical bronchiolitis symptoms has also been recommended in centers without private patient rooms for all admissions. However, because clinical bronchiolitis may be caused by more than 1 etiologic agent, 10 the use of rapid respiratory testing platforms gives clinicians information that may allow for more focused isolation and cohorting of patients in real time. The study hypothesis is that the use of combined isolation precautions should be continued, even after the H1N1 pandemic, in pediatric patients with URI symptoms based on the detection of pathogen coinfections by use of a small volume polymerase chain reaction (SVPCR) array respiratory panel (RP) that requires both droplet and contact isolation precautions.

804,3138828,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory tract infections in infants, with remarkable variability in disease severity. Factors determining severity of disease in previously healthy infants are still unclear. It was hypothesized that disease severity is correlated with viral load in primary RSV infection. Infants of a healthy birth cohort were included at signs of their first respiratory tract infection. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained within 48-96 hr and disease severity was assessed with a previously published severity scoring model. PCR was applied to test the aspirates in a semi-quantitative way for the presence of 10 respiratory pathogens. In case of multiple infection, the pathogen with the highest load was defined as the primary pathogen. The correlation between disease severity and viral load was analyzed. A total of 82 infants were included over a period of 2 years. Median age at first respiratory tract infection was 3 months. Pathogens were detected in 77 (94%) infants; more than one pathogen was detected in 35 (43%) infants. RSV was present in aspirates of 30 infants; in 16 aspirates RSV was the primary pathogen. A negative correlation between RSV CT-value and disease severity was found in all RSV cases (r ¼ À0.52, P ¼ 0.003) and in cases with RSV as the primary pathogen (r ¼ À0.54, P ¼ 0.03). In conclusion, this is the first report on viral loads in previously healthy infants with RSV infection in the community.

808,3055393,"We established a timeline emphasizing evidence of human-to-human transmission. By January 1, 2020, Chinese authorities had been presented convincing evidence of human-to-human transmission; however, it was until January 20, 2020 that this information was shared with the public. Our study estimated that there would have been 10,989 total infected cases if interventions were taken on January 2, 2020, vs 239,875 cases when lockdown was put in place on January 23, 2020."
809,2931023,"Relatively short intervals of exposure times are used to provide some reasonably precise information concerning incubation, as is done in AIDS seroconverter cohorts [6] . Table I provides some comparison of the 67 cases with infection intervals less than 5 days with the cases with longer intervals. The variables examined were age, sex, health care worker status, vital status on hospital discharge and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, where higher values of LDH re ect more severe disease. It can be seen that while the cases are similar in age, sex and worker status, there is a higher death rate and some evidence of more severe disease in the cases with the longer possible infection intervals. This may re ect the fact that more severe cases arriving at a hospital might well have had a longer period with the disease and be less able to characterize precisely their possible time of infection. The impact of extending the allowed interval size is examined later. There remains, of course, the implicit assumption that the cases with some information on infection time are a random sample of the entire distribution of cases. However, the possibility of biases in reporting, heterogeneity in routes of transmission or varying infectious doses of the SARS coronavirus remains."

Microbiol., The porcine epidemic coronavirus ( PEDV ), tentatively classified as a coronavirus, was adapted to Vero cells and a plaque test developed for infectivity titration, allowing us to test the biological and biophysical properties of the virus. Growth kinetics showed peak titers of l0 ss' plaque-forming units ml -~ 15 h after infection. Filtration experiments and electron microscopy revealed a particle diameter between 100 and 200 nm. The buoyant density of the virus was 1.18. The particle lost its infectivity on treatment with lipid solvents. Virus replication could not be inhibited by 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. PEDV was moderately stable at 50°C, but heat sensitivity was not altered by divalent cations. At 4 ° C, the virus was stable between pH 5.0 and 9.0, but at 37 °C stability was restricted to the pH range 6.5-7.5. Viral infectivity was not impaired by ultrasonication or by multiple freezing and thawing. PEDV was not neutralized by transmissible gastroenteritis virus antiserum. On the basis of the tests carried out, PEDV is a pleomorphic, enveloped RNA virus with a particle diameter of ~ 150 nm and a buoyant density of 1.18. Infectivity depends on the presence of trypsin, and infected cells show a tendency to fuse and to form syncytia. All of these properties, as well as its physicochemical characteristics, allow PEDV to be classified as a coronavirus."
813,1628875,"Until the identification of the new SARS-CoV, the coronaviruses have been divided into three subgroups, which differ with respect to their genome [24] . The first group consists of viruses such as the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteritis virus (FEV) or the canine coronavirus (CCoV). The second group comprises human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and the third group mainly consists of avian species such as the chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Whereas the SARS-CoV has been shown to crossreact with some group I coronavirus antibodies [6] , its genetic sequence does not belong to this group. Within the nucleic acid or protein sequence phylogenetic trees of the coronavirus family, the SARS-CoV has first been located at an equal distance from the second and third group, irrespective of which SARS-CoV RNA region is used for analysis [6, 16, 17] . Therefore, the SARS-CoV may represent the first member of a new group of coronaviruses ( Figure 1 ). However, the taxonomy is still no clear [19, 25] , and recent studies that focused on the N-terminal domain of the spike protein and on poorly conserved proteins such as Nsp1, matrix protein, or nucleocapsid, have suggested a relation to group II viruses [26] . A similar conclusion can be drawn if the polymerase gene is examined, pointing to an early split-off from the coronavirus group 2 lineage [27] ."
814,1628459,"Recent cases of fatal encephalitis in humans due to BoDV-1 infection strengthen the need to survey potential wildlife reservoirs and identify potential risk factors for infection. Although the bicolored white-toothed shrew has been identified as indigenous reservoir of BoDV-1, other potential reservoirs or animal carriers are still unknown so that further investigations of small mammals including bat species are urgently needed. Bats have already been discovered as reservoir of emerging and highly pathogenic viruses. Many factors, such as their gregarious way of life, can facilitate pathogen transmission to other bats and virus persistence in the population. In European bats, only few zoonotic viruses have been discovered [18, 33, 34] and the overall hazard for humans is comparably low [18] . As some bats take roosts in barns and stables [20] and bat carcasses are found in close proximity to agriculture [35] , a risk of sporadic transmission events to livestock animals can be assumed if viruses can be detected. Animal movement across borders of endemic regions during hunting and migration of bats seems to contradict stable geographical clustering of BoDV-1 isolates and the hypothesis of a territorially bound reservoir [5] . Nonetheless, consistent usage of the same roosts as summer or winter quarter may support observed clustering and could facilitate rare endemic transmission. Additionally, the molecular evidence for co-evolution of bats and bornaviruses [22, 27] could suggest the possibility of infections of other potentially so far unknown bornaviruses beside the tested orthobornaviruses. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the possible role of bats as carrier and reservoir of orthobornaviruses such as BoDV-1 as one of the most common virus."

Such strategies offer the hope of providing mental health services in an easily accessible manner without any increase in infection risk.

Moreover, they have not yet been tested or validated in the respective target populations."
817,1628890,"Although human coronaviruses are characteristically causing self-limiting short diseases, the question of potential chronic SARS infections is of major importance for a future disease control. If the SARS-CoV is able to cause a chronic persistent infection, chronic carriers may serve as sources for new SARS outbreaks. However, the detection of SARS-CoV in stool of patients for longer periods than 6 weeks after hospital discharge has not been reported so far. Therefore, the danger of chronic carriers may not be relevant. In contrast to common human coronavirus infections with short durations, most animal coronaviruses cause persistent infections. As an example, the feline coronavirus FIPV infects animals which then continue to shed virus for periods reaching up to seven months after infection without carrying disease symptoms [46] . Also, TGEV and MHV tend to cause chronic infections as these viruses may be found in the airways and small intestine (TGEV) or the nervous system (MHV) several months after infection [47, 48] . Although the SARS-CoV has jumped to humans it may still have this property of inducing chronic infections. Thus, SARS-CoV RNA was found in patients' stool specimen more than 30 days after the infections."

Current vaccine costs are high and typically exceed $1000 for a course of rabies immune globulin and five doses of vaccine given over a four (4)-week period [58] . Thus, there is an urgent need for a cheaper rabies vaccine. The rabies virus (RABV) belongs to the genus Lyssavirus in the family Rhabdoviridae. The RNA of RABV encodes five proteins, including the G glycoprotein that carries the main antigenic sites. Human infection usually occurs following a transdermal bite or scratch by an infected animal. Already in 1993, Fu et al.

It is a new θ-SEIHRD model (not a SIR, SEIR or other general purpose model), which takes into account the known special characteristics of this disease, as the existence of infectious undetected cases and the different sanitary and infectiousness conditions of hospitalized people. In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction θ of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. The model is also able to estimate the needs of beds in hospitals. It is complex enough to capture the most important effects, but also simple enough to allow an affordable identification of its parameters, using the data that authorities report on this pandemic."
824,3070740,"Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 ABSTRACT Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is accompanied by the shedding of the virus in stool. Therefore, the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater affords the ability to monitor the prevalence of infections amongst the population via wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE). In the current work, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was concentrated from wastewater in a catchment in Australia and viral RNA copies were enumerated using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) resulting in two positive detections within a six day period from the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). The estimated RNA copy numbers observed in the wastewater were then used to estimate the number of infected individuals in the catchment via Monte Carlo simulation. Given the uncertainty and variation in the input parameters, the model estimated a median range of 171 to 1,090 infected persons in the catchment, which is in reasonable agreement with clinical observations. This work highlights the viability of WBE for monitoring infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, in communities. The work also draws attention to the need for further methodological and molecular assay validation for enveloped viruses in wastewater."

Seven of these ten children had human metapneumovirus alone; the other three children also had other respiratory viruses.

A chest radiograph shows infiltrates and widespread consolidation in severe cases. Approximately 20% of patients with SARS develop acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and the disease may progress, with pulmonary fibrosis. No specific treatment has been available, although antiviral drugs (e.g., ribavirin) and high doses of glucocorticoids have been given. Measures have also been taken to support vital functions.

828,1013038,"The 28 individuals recorded a total of 1792 contacts. Of these, 9 were dropped from subsequent analysis since they were reported twice on the same day. A summary of the contacts at the different levels of intensity is given in table 1 (a and b). On average individuals made 26 contacts per day during the week and 19 per day during the weekend, a difference that was statistically significant ( Table 2 ). There were no significant differences in the number of individuals contacted by sex or living arrangements (Table 2) . Interaction terms were also tested, but none were significant. Seventy-five percent (1340) of the people contacted were only contacted on one of the study days. Figure 1 shows the mean cumulative number of different individuals contacted over the three days at each of the intensities (note that the results for Level 4 are plotted on a different scale). It is clear that there are very different patterns in the acquisition of new ""partners"" for the different levels of contact. The students in this study recorded approximately 0.7 Level 1 contacts (physical contact without conversation) per day and these contacts were with different individuals from day to day (as indicated by the linear increase in the cumulative number of contacts). That is, there was no evidence that, for this level of contact, they started to have repeat contacts with the same individuals over the study period. In contrast, half of the participants reported a Level 4 contact on the first sampling occasion but there was only one new individual contacted (at this level) during the remaining sampling occasions (note that each Level 4 contact was contacted twice, on average, over the three days). The pattern in the acquisition of new ""partners"" for the other two levels of contact were intermediate between the two extremes."
829,2915603,"Auto-immunity to fibrillarin has been associated with the disease scleroderma [20, 73] , and auto-immunity to nucleolin with systematic lupus erythematosus [31] . Viral antigens which localise to the nucleolus of infected cells and displace (or mimic) nucleolar antigens, might therefore stimulate the host immune response into producing antibodies to viral proteins that could have the potential to bind with the equivalent host proteins through structural mimicry. For example, poliovirus infection, which prevents nucleolin from entering the nucleus [76] , may cause an increase in nucleolin in the cytoplasm and concomitant increase in cell surface expression. Thus, understanding the basis of viral protein interactions with the nucleolar milieu, and its consequences, may extend our understanding of how such autoimmune conditions develop."
830,2697607,"On the other hand, in Italy, the reported cases have grown impressively over time, leading to the country obtaining a prominent position in the international scenario of the infected patients. This emerging pandemic and its severe outbreak in the Italian population have induced the Italian Government first and then the European Union to promote drastic impact measures to ""flatten the curve"" of the COVID-19 infection and in turn avoid health systems (in particular, intensive care units) being overwhelmed, resulting in fewer deaths [1] . The limitation of people circulating outside their home, social distancing, the cessation of almost all working activities and the request to the population to use protective masks and gloves all have the aim of minimizing the likelihood that people who are not infected come into contact with others who are already infected and probably still asymptomatic [2] . As always happens, healthcare professionals have been immediately involved in the national emergency, working hard, often day and night: unfortunately, small numbers of them have also become infected, and some have tragically died. Dentists are often the first line of diagnosis, as they work in close contact with patients. On 15 March 2020, the New York Times published an article entitled ""The Workers Who Face the Greatest Coronavirus Risk"", where an impressive schematic figure described that dentists are the workers most exposed to the risk of being affected by COVID-19, much more than nurses and general physicians [3] . To take significant actions against this harmful disease, the American Dental Association updated its webpage in March, including a link to frequently asked questions from member dentists covering topics such as personal protective equipment and patient communications. Recently, an interesting paper written by researchers from Wuhan University School and Hospital of Stomatology was published with several recommendations for dentists and dental students to manage COVID-19 patients [4] . Dentists have been recommended to take several personal protection measures and avoid or minimize operations that can produce droplets or aerosols; moreover, the use of saliva ejectors with a low volume or high volume can reduce the production of droplets and aerosols. Taking into consideration the severity of the pandemic COVID-19, and in the light of the massive commitment of several dental associations and the most prestigious dental journals, it is essential to give clear and easy guidelines to manage dental patients and to make working dentists safe from any risk. A fundamental concept is that the transmission of the virus is mainly through inhalation/ingestion/direct mucous contact with saliva droplets; it is also critical to remember that the virus can survive on hands, objects or surfaces that were exposed to infected saliva in the previous nine days [4, 5] . Since the viral load contained in the human saliva is very high, rinses with antiseptic mouthwashes can only reduce the infectious amount but are not able to eliminate the virus in the saliva [4, 5] . In this light, a few important concepts would be useful to briefly report and discuss here."

At higher dilutions the fluorescence gradually diminished until no difference between TGE virus-infected and uninfected cells could be seen which facilitated end point determination."
832,3079956,"Several case clusters occurred in high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong in the 2003 SARS (the severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic, which motivated a series of engineering investigations into the possible airborne transport routes. It is suspected that, driven by buoyancy force, the polluted air that exits the window of the lower floor may re-enter the immediate upper floor through the window on the same side. This cascade effect has been quantified and reported in a previous paper, and it is found that, by tracer gas concentration analysis, the room in the adjacent upstairs may contain up to 7% of the air directly from the downstairs room. In this study, after validation against the experimental data from literatures, Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are both adopted to numerically investigate the dispersion of expiratory aerosols between two vertically adjacent flats. It is found that the particle concentration in the upper floor is two to three orders of magnitude lower than in the source floor. 1.0 mm particles disperse like gaseous pollutants. For coarse particles larger than 20.0 mm, strong deposition on solid surfaces and gravitational settling effect greatly limit their upward transport."
833,807777,"As human populations continue to increase, more people will move into areas that have not previously been inhabited and alter the environment to suit their purposes, whether for housing or agriculture; interactions with native wildlife and invertebrate vectors of disease will increase as a result. 19, 20 One study found that increased interactions with wildlife occurred in suburban and exurban communities, while fewer interactions occurred in more densely populated communities. 21 Interactions may lead to increased exposure to zoonotic pathogens through direct contact with animals, contact with infected urine, feces, pelts or a carcass, or exposure to vectors such as ticks or fleas. Zooanthroponotic pathogen (those passed from humans to animals) exposure to animals may also increase with these interactions. 22 Additionally, as humans move into previously uninhabited areas, consumption of native wildlife may increase leading to increased exposure to zoonotic agents. Historically, tularemia was associated with rabbit hunting, and now Ebola virus outbreaks are associated with the bush meat trade in Africa. 23 Larger human populations will require increasingly larger amounts of protein for sustenance, and some of this protein will undoubtedly come from wildlife. Finally, because of increased ease of international travel and globalization of cultures, humans, animals, and pathogens can travel the globe quickly allowing diseases to spread rapidly worldwide. 24 Although dogs and cats are still the largest population of pets in the US, the American Veterinary Medical Association reports that ownership has increased from 2001 to 2007 for the following other types of pets: fish, ferrets, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, other rodents (not specifically identified), turtles, snakes, and lizards. 25 A category titled ""all others"" also increased from 2001 to 2007, but the specific animals included in this category were not listed. The total number of birds kept as pets has increased, but the number of households owning birds decreased in the same time period. In general, the number of households with pets other than dogs and cats is increasing. Depending on the country of origin of these exotic pets, and what importation and quarantine procedures are performed, exotic pets may carry zoonoses that have not previously been identified in that particular geographic area 19 ; numerous outbreaks of zoonoses have been associated with the legal and illegal importation of animals in the pet trade. 20 The identification of monkeypox in a population of pet prairie dogs in the midwestern US is an excellent example of how non-native exotic rodents that were carrying a zoonotic agent uncommon to the US transmitted the virus to native rodents in the pet trade; no human cases were directly caused by the non-native exotic rodents. 6 Global climate change is occurring and is unlikely to slow without significant measures by humans. 26 These climate changes are not only expected to directly affect humans through more severe and prolonged weather events, but also by changing the home range of wildlife species and vectors of disease, such as ticks, and altering the time when a disease can typically be transmitted to humans. One recent study predicts that the range of Ixodes scapularis, the primary tick that transmits the etiologic agent of Lyme disease in the US, will noticeably expand in the next two decades with the predicted rate of climate change; this change in range of the vector species will also affect the geographic distribution of the disease in humans and animals, such as dogs. 27 Another paper suggests that the current ranges of plague and tularemia are likely to shift north due to changes in range of host rodent species, although the changes will likely be subtle. 28 Prevalence, intensity, and geographic distribution of disease due to some helminths are also expected to change with changes in climate. 29 Finally, milder winters and earlier springs may lead to alterations in the typical transmission period of some vector borne diseases. For example, West Nile virus, which typically peaks in late summer, could be transmitted earlier in the year leading to a higher incidence of disease in humans earlier in the year. 26 The total effects of climate change on zoonotic disease transmission and distribution is still unknown, and there are many factors that complicate predictions. 26 Regardless of the specifics, alterations in disease distribution and transmission are expected as a result of changes in climate."
834,75891,"The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) provides a further challenge in the battle against outbreaks of novel virus infections and has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. Much has been learnt in the course of preceding epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and H1N1 influenza, and it is now recognized that their overall health burden may be underestimated since extra-pulmonary manifestations are frequent. 1 Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of pneumonia are common and result from various mechanisms, including relative ischaemia, systemic inflammation, and pathogen-mediated damage. There is, however, only limited published data concerning cardiovascular presentations in the wake of viral epidemics. The present COVID-19 outbreak emphasizes the need for greater awareness of the immediate and long-term cardiovascular implications of viral infection and the significant gaps in knowledge that future research will need to address."

839,3125060,"Using the parameterized susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, we simulated the spread dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and impact of different control measures, conducted the sensitivity analysis to identify the key factor, plotted the trend curve of effective reproductive number (R), and performed data fitting after the simulation. By simulation and data fitting, the model showed the peak existing confirmed cases of 59 769 arriving on 15 February 2020, with the coefficient of determination close to 1 and the fitting bias 3.02%, suggesting high precision of the datafitting results. More rigorous government control policies were associated with a slower increase in the infected population. Isolation and protective procedures would be less effective as more cases accrue, so the optimization of the treatment plan and the development of specific drugs would be of more importance. There was an upward trend of R in the beginning, followed by a downward trend, a temporary rebound, and another continuous decline. The feature of high infectiousness for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) led to an upward trend, and government measures contributed to the temporary rebound and declines. The declines of R could be exploited as strong evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions. Evidence from the fourphase stringent measures showed that it was significant to ensure early detection, early isolation, early treatment, adequate medical supplies, patients' being admitted to designated hospitals, and comprehensive therapeutic strategy. Collaborative efforts are required to combat the novel coronavirus, focusing on both persistent strict domestic interventions and vigilance against exogenous imported cases."
840,1392543,"The model reproduced the observed temporal trend of cases within Wuhan and cases exported internationally, capturing all of the dynamics reflected by these different data streams ( Figure 2B -D). Our results suggested there were around tenfold more symptomatic cases in Wuhan in late January than were reported as confirmed cases ( Figure 2E ), but the model not predict the slowdown in cases that was observed in early February. The model could also reproduce the pattern of confirmed exported cases from Wuhan, which was not explicitly used in the model fitting ( Figure 2F ). We found that confirmed and estimated exported cases among the twenty countries most connected to China were generally in good correspondence, with the USA and Australia as notable outliers, having had more confirmed cases reported with a travel history to Wuhan than would be expected in the model ( Figure 2G ). We estimated that 100% (95% CI: 51-100%) of cases would be eventually had detectable symptoms, implying that most infections that were exported internationally from Wuhan in late January were eventually detected."

842,3104570,"Feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPVs) are classified into type I and type II serogroups. Here, we report that feline aminopeptidase N (APN), a cell-surface metalloprotease on the intestinal, lung and kidney epithelial cells, is a receptor for type II FIPV but not for type I FIPV. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) R-G-4, which blocks infection of Felis catus whole fetus (fcwf-4) cells by type II FIPV, was obtained by immunizing mice with fcwf-4 cells which are highly susceptible to FIPV. This MAb also blocked infection of fcwf-4 cells by type II feline enteric coronavirus (FECV), canine coronavirus (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). On the other hand, it did not block infection by type I FIPVs. MAb R-G-4 recognized a polypeptide of relative molecular mass 120-130 kDa in feline intestinal brush-border membrane (BBM) proteins. The polypeptide possessed aminopeptidase activity, and the first 15 N-terminal amino acid sequence was identical to that of the feline APN. Feline intestinal BBM proteins and the polypeptide reacted with MAb R-G-4 (feline APN) inhibited the infectivity of type II FIPV, type II FECV, CCV and TGEV to fcwf-4 cells, but did not inhibit the infectivity of type I FIPVs."

A total of 126 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected from hospitalized patients with ARI, all with difficult breathing or hypoxemia (oxygen saturation < 90% on room air), between September 2014 and December 2014. Demographic data and clinical symptoms of the enrolled patients were obtained from clinical charts including clinical diagnosis, age, gender, signs and symptoms at admission, underlying medical conditions, antibiotic usage prior to admission, physical examination, laboratory findings, length of hospital stay, oxygen requirement, and results from bacterial molecular detection."
844,2744296,"In contrast to children, in whom URTI was the predominant diagnosis, hospitalized adults with HRV-C infection most commonly presented with pneumonia. Although the detection rate of HRV-C infection was higher among children in the present study, adults with HRV-C infection appeared to present with more-severe illness. HRV-C infection has been mostly described in infants and young children with acute respiratory illness. In line with our results reported elsewhere [22] , children with HRV-C infection in the present study commonly present with URTI, febrile wheeze, and asthmatic exacerbations. One child also presented with acute otitis media, which concurred with the detection of HRV-C in middle ear fluid samples from patients with acute otitis media in another report [25] . On the other hand, relatively little is known about the significance of HRV-C infection in the adult population. In a study from Australia, 2 of the 17 identified strains were from adults, of whom 1 experienced an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [21] . In 2 other studies that mentioned the detection of novel HRVs, which corresponded to HRV-C, in respiratory tract samples from adults, no further clinical details were provided [23, 28] . In the present study, 8 (62%) of the 13 adults with HRV-C infection had pneumonia, compared with 6 (27%) of the 22 adults with HRV-A infection ( ) P ! .05 (Table 2) . Although most of the adults with HRV-C infection had underlying diseases or were of advanced age, 1 of the 8 patients with pneumonia was a 45-year-old healthy man who presented with left upper lobe consolidation without identifiable coinfecting pathogens. Among the 16 cases of HRV-C-associated pneumonia, 6 were caused by viruses of 3 different clusters (2 closely related strains from each cluster), respectively ( Figure 2 ). Wheezing episodes were also more common in patients with HRV-C (37%) and HRV-A (20%) infection, compared with that in patients with HRV-B (0%) infection (P ! ). Although children with HRV-C infection most often pre-.05 sented with URTI, the disease course was not uncommonly complicated by asthmatic exacerbations or febrile wheeze triggered by the virus infection. Further clinical studies that involve more patients with HRV infection are required to investigate whether certain HRV species or strains may be more virulent than others."

Unfortunately, influenza vaccinations and most other adult vaccinations have not seen similar success. Although influenza vaccination rates improved in the 2018 to 2019 season compared with prior years, the rate overall was only 45.3% (far short of the 70% goal of Healthy People 2020), and rates were substantially lower among African American, Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native adults (7) . Achieving the desired population benefit of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will require an implementation strategy that addresses the current gaps in overall rates of adult vaccination, as well as specific issues in minority communities. Establishing and nurturing trust and partnerships within affected communities will be critical because diminished trust in health care borne from a legacy of unethical experimentation, including the Tuskegee study, has been identified as an important contributor to vaccine hesitancy among African Americans (8, 9) ."
846,644661,"As of April 2, 2020, data on 149,760 laboratory-confirmed U.S. COVID-19 cases were available for analysis. Among 149,082 (99.6%) cases for which patient age was known, 2,572 (1.7%) occurred in children aged <18 years and 146,510 (98%) in adults aged ≥18 years, including 113,985 (76%) aged 18-64 years. Among the 2,572 pediatric cases, 850 (33%) were reported from New York City; 584 (23%) from the rest of New York state; 393 (15%) from New Jersey; and the remaining 745 (29%) from other jurisdictions. The distribution of reporting jurisdictions for pediatric cases was similar to that of reporting jurisdictions for cases among adults aged ≥18 years, except that a lower percentage of adult cases was reported from New York state (14%). The first pediatric U.S. COVID-19 case was reported to CDC on March 2, 2020; since March 5, pediatric cases have been reported daily ( Figure 1 ). Among all 2,572 COVID-19 cases in children aged <18 years, the median age was 11 years (range 0-17 years). Nearly one third of reported pediatric cases (813; 32%) occurred in children aged 15-17 years, followed by those in children aged 10-14 years (682; 27%). Among younger children, 398 (15%) occurred in children aged <1 year, 291 (11%) in children aged 1-4 years, and 388 (15%) in children aged 5-9 years. Among 2,490 pediatric COVID-19 cases for which sex was known, 1,408 (57%) occurred in males; among cases in adults aged ≥18 years for which sex was known, 53% (75,450 of 143,414) were in males. Among 184 (7.2%) cases in children aged <18 years with known exposure information, 16 (9%) were associated with travel and 168 (91%) had exposure to a COVID-19 patient in the household or community. Data on signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were available for 291 of 2,572 (11%) pediatric cases and 10,944 of 113,985 (9.6%) cases among adults aged 18-64 years (Table) . Whereas fever (subjective or documented), cough, and shortness of breath were commonly reported among adult patients aged 18-64 years (93% reported at least one of these), these signs and symptoms were less frequently reported among pediatric patients (73%). Among those with known information on each symptom, 56% of pediatric patients reported fever, 54% reported cough, and 13% reported shortness of breath, compared with 71%, 80%, and 43%, respectively, reporting these signs and symptoms among patients aged 18-64 years. Myalgia, sore throat, headache, and diarrhea were also less commonly reported by pediatric patients. Fifty-three (68%) of the 78 pediatric cases reported not to have fever, cough, or shortness of breath had no symptoms reported, but could not be classified as asymptomatic because of incomplete symptom information. One (1.3%) additional pediatric patient with a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be asymptomatic."
847,2122092,"According to the WHO, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, which at the time of writing had affected over 100,000 people and caused over 3000 deaths worldwide [1] . As of Feb, 21th 2020, the virus has affected 3,019 healthcare workers (HCWs) with 5 deaths [2] . The fact that HCWs are at risk of infection in the epidemic chain is a critical issue because HCWs help in controlling the outbreak. Therefore, all possible actions must be taken to control the spread of the infection to HCWs, first by identifying the risk factors for infection and then by taking appropriate measures to reduce these risks."
848,1119123,"Due to the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the potential for rapid spread of the disease, and the absence of proven effective and safe in vivo inhibitors of the virus, it is important to identify drugs that can effectively be used to treat or prevent potential SARS-CoV infections. Many novel therapeutic approaches have been evaluated in laboratory studies of SARS-CoV: notable among these approaches are those using siRNA [7] , passive antibody transfer [8] , DNA vaccination [9] , vaccinia or parainfluenza virus expressing the spike protein [10, 11] , interferons [12, 13] , and monoclonal antibody to the S1-subunit of the spike glycoprotein that blocks receptor binding [14] . In this report, we describe the identification of chloroquine as an effective pre-and post-infection antiviral agent for SARS-CoV. Chloroquine, a 9-aminoquinoline that was identified in 1934, is a weak base that increases the pH of acidic vesicles. When added extracellularly, the non-protonated portion of chloroquine enters the cell, where it becomes protonated and concentrated in acidic, low-pH organelles, such as endosomes, Golgi vesicles, and lysosomes. Chloroquine can affect virus infection in many ways, and the antiviral effect depends in part on the extent to which the virus utilizes endosomes for entry. Chloroquine has been widely used to treat human diseases, such as malaria, amoebiosis, HIV, and autoimmune diseases, without significant detrimental side effects [15] . Together with data presented here, showing virus inhibition in cell culture by chloroquine doses compatible with patient treatment, these features suggest that further evaluation of chloroquine in animal models of SARS-CoV infection would be warranted as we progress toward finding effective antivirals for prevention or treatment of the disease."

850,1119043,"& From a public health perspective, it is important to prioritize the allocation of public and private funding and resources to expand the implementation of Telemental Health and its integration across multiple clinical settings, including primary care. Funneling funding in this direction may contribute to enhanced preparedness and management of current and future similar public health crises. The funding should also be complemented by training clinicians and familiarizing patients with the use of Telemental Health to overcome travel restrictions, to maintain access to treatment when mobility is compromised. Additionally, it may be essential to facilitate setting the infrastructural landscape for Telemental Health in terms of hardware and software in preparation, which includes enhancing connectivity and expanding access to broadband high-speed Internet across the country. & From a reimbursement perspective, the lifting of CMS reimbursement restrictions, including those based on originating site and geographical locations of patients, should be made permanent. Expanding access to mental health services across the country contributes to supporting the continuity of care, particularly since the repercussions of this public health crisis are likely to be long term. Furthermore, efforts should be made to urge private payers and managed care organizations to expand Telemental Health coverage, with the goal of achieving full parity for mental health services regardless of whether delivered in person or remotely. & From a regulatory perspective, the temporary lifting of the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act restriction on prescribing controlled substances via Telemental Health should be made permanent in order to ensure expanded access to care continues after the public health crisis is declared to be over. Lobbying for policy reforms by professional societies, such as the American Telemedicine Association and American Psychiatric Association, is needed to achieve this goal, particularly that the Act was passed in 2008 [18] , and the landscape of Telemental Health has rapidly evolved since. & Given that state licensure has been a documented barrier to the expansion of Telemental Health [13] , it is crucial to temporarily suspend restrictions on licensure requirements to practice Telemental Health across state lines, to regions of the country that are most impacted by the pandemic [19] . In the long term, it is important to expand processes that facilitate interstate licensure for better preparedness for future crises. & Finally, in the context of a public health crisis of this magnitude, and with the rapidly changing landscape of regulations and reimbursement for Telemental Health, consistent access to reliable information and updates on regulatory and reimbursement changes is crucial. While we urge healthcare professionals to remain vigilant and up to date, we also urge CMS, DEA, and other health authorities to continue to provide regular and clear guidance to healthcare professionals as we work diligently to overcome the COVID-19 public health crisis."

Figure 2 shows the smoothed kernel density of the cross-section of beliefs, for the 1-year expected return ( Fig. 2A) and for the probability of a stock market disaster (Fig. 2B) . The dashed and solid lines plot the distributions of beliefs before and after the crash, respectively. The dispersion in beliefs across individuals, i.e., the level of disagreement, increased substantially after the market crash, as visible from the widening of both densities. The cross-sectional standard deviation (across respondents) of reported 1-year expected stock returns almost doubled from 5.3% to 9.9% between the two waves. The response of disagreement is asymmetric, with pessimism --the left tail of Fig. 2A ---becoming substantially more pronounced in the investor population: the cross-sectional skewness of beliefs almost doubles from -0.32 to -0.5; the 10 th percentile moves from 2% to -15%, whereas the 90 th percentile remains essentially stable, falling to 10% from 12%.

The PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 20 μL (15 μL PCR reaction mixture and 5 μL template RNA). Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 50°C for 30 min, followed by 95°C for 10 min, and then 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C and 60 sec at 60°C. Viral template-positive controls and no-template controls were included in each run. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was amplified simultaneously as a heterologous endogenous internal control to monitor PCR inhibition and specimen quality. A positive test result was defined as a well-defined exponential fluorescence curve that crossed the threshold ≤ 37 cycles, ≤ 38 cycles, and ≤ 35 cycles for the upE, ORF1a, and GAPDH genes, respectively. Nested RT-PCR and sequencing targeting the RdRp and N genes were performed for confirmation, according to the previous protocols [4] . Briefly, the first round of RT-PCR for the two genes was performed by using the primer sets described in the previous report.

855,1926192,"HRV was the second most frequent viral agent detected, with positive results for 17% of patients with ILI, including all age groups. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies suggesting that HRV is responsible for a large proportion of acute respiratory tract infections in both adults and children, composing 10% to >40% of respiratory infections [12, 16, 29, 30] . HRV circulated year-round, a finding shown in other studies [7, 12, 15] . Increased HRV circulation coincided with a period of decreased activity for influenza virus, a situation also observed in Madagascar [7] . In our study, HRV was the most frequent virus detected in children <5 years of age (25.6%). This finding contrasts with other studies conducted in Senegal [6] and China [11] , where the predominant virus detected in children <5 years of age was RSV. This difference could be due to different inclusion criteria for the study subjects. We included mostly children with upper respiratory tract infection; the studies conducted in Senegal and China also included children with lower respiratory tract infection. HRV has been reported to be the major cause of upper respiratory tract infections in children in Italy [29] ."
856,2034301,"The IFITM family consists of four (human) or six (mouse) proteins, all of which are highly homologous and presumably structurally related. However, they do exhibit preferential antiviral specificities that appear to be linked to their mechanisms of action. In general, IFITMs have been shown to inhibit an early viral entry step, with numerous studies implicating virion fusion 55, [62] [63] [64] [65] . Their specificity is thought to be dictated in part by the cellular location of virion fusion, for example, late endosomes or lysosomes. IFITM proteins were originally shown to potently inhibit influenza A virus and several flaviviruses 65 , and the list of targeted viruses continues to grow 55 . Ifitm3 −/− mice were recently generated and showed fulminant viral pneumonia and a striking mortality phenotype when challenged with an influenza A virus that exhibits otherwise low pathogenicity in wild type mice 66 . Similar results were obtained with mice that lack the entire Ifitm locus 67 . Ifitm3 −/− mice have also been shown to be more susceptible to respiratory syncytial virus 68 . It should be noted, again, that these laboratory Iftim −/− strains are also functional Mx1-null mice. The striking pathogenic phenotypes with influenza A virus must therefore be considered in the context of this double Ifitm/Mx1-null genotype. Of the hundreds of human ISGs that have been tested in vitro for antiviral against influenza A virus, IFITM3 and MX1 appear to be two of the most potent 7 . Thus, the Ifitm/Mx1-null mouse is likely an extreme example of innate ISGmediated immunodeficiency, at least in the context of influenza A virus infection."
857,1981392,"Despite this apparent paradox, multipartitism is widespread in the Virosphere, as up to 40% of all known viral families are multipartite [7] . A large majority of them infects either plants or fungi, with only four known examples of species infecting exclusively animals [5] . Evolutionary pathways leading to multipartitism are likely to be multiple, since this strategy is present in RNA and DNA viruses, and in the latter case an origin to a single ancestral virus cannot be traced. Beyond its virological interest, multipartitism has a particularly negative effect on agricultural production, as several multipartite viruses are pathogenic, and routinely cripple crop yield [8] . Cultivars themselves may have directly played a role in the rise of multipartitism, as an evolutionary radiation in the diversity of viral species, many being just centuries old, was likely promoted by an intensification of agricultural practices [9] [10] [11] . It has been put forward that multipartite species might be at an advantage in the face of environmental changes, since they likely adapt faster due to new combinations of segments promoted by their genomic architecture [5] . It is known that changes in land cover offer multiple opportunities for novel interactions between plants and pathogens [12] [13] [14] [15] . Studies on the impact of agriculture in viral ecology have uncovered a surprisingly negative association between plant diversity and family-level diversity of plant-associated viruses, and a higher prevalence of viruses in cultivated areas [16] ."
858,2763829,"Emerging infectious diseases have the potential to wreak havoc on agricultural industries and native flora and fauna, and can pose a significant challenge to the health and economic status of both developed and developing countries. The broad-scale drivers of the apparent increase in the number of emerging diseases are well documented, involving such factors as climate change, environmental disruption, an increasingly centralized agricultural system and rapid global transportation, as well as high densities of humans, animals and crops. Combined, these factors have created new opportunities for viruses and other pathogens to change their host range and cause epidemic disease. In humans, this confluence of factors has led to the emergence of a number of high-profile viral infections over the last 40 their appearance (e.g. see [1] ), to establishing more rigorous quantitative frameworks to explain how new infections become established in populations (e.g. [2] [3] [4] ). In particular, there is now a large body of literature devoted to understanding the determinants of disease emergence, with a strong focus on emerging viruses. This work has the implicit and commendable goal of trying to reveal the overarching rules of disease emergence, which in turn might lead to predictions of what virus might emerge next and where this may occur [5] [6] [7] [8] . Gaining this sort of predictive capability would have obvious and wide-ranging benefits. In these approaches, the study of virus emergence is often synonymous with the study of virus evolution, such that the more we understand about the patterns and processes of evolutionary change, the more accurate any emergence prediction is thought to be."
859,362306,"The studies by Wang et al [15] , Zhou et al [16] and Varghese et al [17] are only the first steps towards a possible use of antibiotics and antiparasitic drugs derived from bacteria as antivirals, which may represent another example of the benefits of drug repurposing [42, 43] . Their results have to be confirmed, and it has to be determined whether concentrations within the therapeutic range can be achieved to target viruses. Nonetheless, these studies highlight that the potential antiviral activity of antimicrobials may be untapped. Another lesson from these articles regards the strategy chosen to discover drugs with an antiviral effect. Indeed, no hypothesis, prediction or modelling has been made. In contrast, the strategy was straightforward and consisted of massive high-throughput screening of hundreds or thousands of available drugs, regardless of their known activity spectrum and target or their approved indication. This is a different approach than specifically targeting stages of the virus replication cycle through blocking proteins involved in their progress [44] . In addition, aside from the great interest in approved drugs for the potential treatment of viral infections for which we currently lack antivirals, we usually have, as is the case here for teicoplanin and ivermectin, considerable experience with their use in humans, which could accelerate their access to the clinic."

867,379693,"In contrast to the other Nidovirales, a number of coronaviruses have polycistronic mRNAs which contain up to three ORFs clustered in a single transcription unit. Downstream ORFs are usually translated by leaky scanning but the synthesis of the E proteins of IBV (ORF 3c) and MHV (ORF 5b) may involve internal intiation of translation mediated by a ribosomal landing pad (5, (121) (122) (123) . The N gene of some group II coronaviruses contains a small internal ORF in the 11 reading frame (Fig. 1 ) that is expressed in infected cells (24, 125) . It encodes a hitherto unrecognized structural protein that is not essential for virus replication in vitro and in vivo (119) ."
868,614341,"Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV does not induce significant amounts of IFNs, antiviral genes, RANTES, and IL-6. In agreement with this finding, SARS-CoV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells lack IFN induction [27, 29] . IP-10 and IL-8, however, can be activated by SARS-CoV. This suggests that these chemokines, which are reliable markers of acute-stage SARS [18, 20, 21, 23] , are not only produced in response to IFN-γ after activation of the immune system as suggested, but may also be directly secreted by infected tissue cells. An upregulation of either IP-10 and/or IL-8 was observed in several studies using SARS-CoV-infected Caco-2 cells [24] , macrophages [27] , peripheral blood mononuclear cells [25] , and dendritic cells [29] . Using HEK 293 cells, by contrast, we found that SARS-CoV is able to downregulate also IP-10 and IL-8 pro- Similarly, recent studies showed that peripheral blood monocytes from SARS patients do not produce any cytokines [28] . Thus, chemokine induction by SARS-CoV appears to be highly cell type-specific."
869,1980912,"PDCoV was first detected in Hong Kong (HKU15-44 and HKU15-155 isolates) in 2012 (Woo et al., 2012) . Although it was first detected, there was no association with clinical disease. The first evidence of PDCoV causing a disease was first evident in Ohio, USA in 2014. Soon after the first emergence in Ohio, USA, the virus was then reported in 18 states (Jung et al., 2016) . The rapid widespread of PDCoV was evident when the virus was subsequently reported in China, South Korea, Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam in 2015 (Le et al., 2018; Lee & Lee, 2014; Madapong et al., 2016; Marthaler, Jiang, Collins, & Rossow, 2014; Saeng-Chuto, Lorsirigool, et al., 2017; Song et al., 2015; Wang, Byrum, & Zhang, 2014a , 2014b . Although the first detection of PDCoV in those countries was in 2014-2015, the retrospective investigation of intestinal samples demonstrated that the presence of PDCoV in China, USA and Thailand was as early as 2004 , 2013 and 2013 , respectively (Saeng-Chuto, Stott, et al., 2017 Sinha, Gauger, Zhang, Yoon, & Harmon, 2015) ."
870,1490848,"Horan et al., recently demonstrated that HSV-1 capsid was K48 ubiquitinated in the cytoplasm of infected macrophages and degraded by the proteasome for release of genomic DNA for detection by host DNA sensors to induce an antiviral response [13] . Here, we validated by confocal microscopy (Fig 7B) and immunoprecipitation (Fig 7C) that capsid was ubiquitinated during the course of infection. In addition, we have shown that VEEV capsid was K48 ubiquitinated early in infection (Fig 8A) , which may allow for release of the viral RNA for efficient RNA translation and replication. Interestingly, only 48% co-localization of capsid with K48 ubiquitin was observed, whereas 61% co-localization of capsid with total ubiquitin was observed at the same time point. However, over time a modest decline in K48 ubiquitination of capsid was recorded. This could be ascribed to 3 possible reasons. Firstly, not all of the incoming capsid may be K48 ubiquitinated as there could be other forms of ubiquitination, such as K63, K11 and so forth. Secondly, since capsid is a multi-functional viral protein, not all of the capsid within a cell will be destined for a single function at a time. Thirdly, in an in vitro cell culture system there may be variability and differences in infectivity and signaling patterns which may also be attributed to an unsynchronized cell population. Moreover, the capsid in virions appeared to be ubiquitinated (Fig 9) . This observation, may share a similarity to a Nipah virus study conducted by Wang et al.; where the UPS was required for nuclear cytoplasmic trafficking of the matrix protein, which was necessary for viral budding [42] . Ongoing studies in our laboratory are focused on elucidating the type of ubiquitination that occurs on capsid in virions, and if ubiquitination of the capsid protein is required for viral egress."

872,68132,"Since the discovery of SARS-CoV, we and others have developed molecular diagnostic assays for detecting SARS-CoV RNA (Dristan et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2003a Poon et al., , 2003b Poon et al., , 2004 . In particular, we recently reported a highly sensitive two step quantitative RT-PCR assay for early SARS diagnosis which has been validated on relevant clinical specimens (Poon et al., 2003a) . In order to reduce hands-on processing time and handling procedures, we have modified this assay into a one step RT-PCR assay. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the test is 86.2% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we further modified this assay into a duplex assay that allows simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and 18S rRNA as an internal positive control. The detection of 18S rRNA enables us to discriminate false-negative due to PCR inhibitors. To avoid interference with the amplification of ORF1b sequence, the concentration of primers specific for the 18S rRNA was limited to 100 nM, a concentration eight times lower than the one for SARS-CoV detection. Results generated from the duplex assay correlates exactly with that of the monoplex assay, demonstrating the internal positive control could be detected with no discernible effect on target sequence detection. In conclusion, we have reported a one step quantitative RT-PCR assay for simultaneous detection of SARS-CoV and 18S rRNA sequences."

Further studies by immunoblot and confocal microscopy analyses revealed the expression and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization of the recombinant SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells. Expression of SARS 6 protein in mammalian cells elicits biological activity of stimulating cellular DNA synthesis."
874,1982405,"It is important to figure out how to screen and diagnose COVID-19 early in order to prevent imported nosocomial infections. This study showed that clinical symptoms and blood test may provide important clues. No significant between-group difference was observed in fever, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, platelet count, or kidney function. In addition to dry cough, COVID-19 was characterized by lower WBC, neutrophil count and percentage, and lymphocyte count and percentage, which, combined with the history of exposure to individuals from Hubei and positive nucleic acid test results, may help diagnose COVID-19. In COVID-19 patients, chest CT showed the following characteristics: 1) in most cases, CT showed typical visceral pleural inflammatory exudate on days 5-7 of onset (Figure 2A , day 6 of onset, 'inflammation line', yellow arrow); 2) typical CT findings included multiple hazy, patchy ground glass opacities near the visceral pleura in the middle and lower lobes ( Figure 2B , day 10 of onset, red arrow); 3) in mild cases, CT showed small, patchy ground glass opacities without clear boundaries ( Figure 2C , day 2 of onset, red arrow);4)in severe cases, chest CT showed bilateral multiple large, patchy ground glass opacities with consolidation ( Figure 2D , day 8 of onset, red arrow). Non-COVID-19 was associated with different time of onset, disease course, disease severities, and chest CT findings. In rhinovirus infection combined with influenza B pneumonia, CT showed bilateral scattered patchy opacities and parenchymal bands with bronchiectasis ( Figure 2E , day 14 of onset, red arrow). Cytomegalovirus infection combined with fungal, bacterial, or pneumocystis pneumoniais usually seen after organ (Kidney) transplant; in our cytomegalovirus patients, chest CT showed bilateral scattered ground glass opacities with interstitial consolidation ( Figure 2F , day 14 of onset, red arrow). In severe influenza A pneumonia, CT showed bilateral diffuse bronchial thickening, with parenchymal bands and consolidation around the bronchi ( Figure 2G , day 8 of onset, red arrow). In severe respiratory syncytial virus pneumonia with rheumatoid arthritis, chest CT showed multiple patchy opacities, parenchymal bands, ground glass opacities, consolidation, reticular markings, and interstitial fibrosisin both lungs ( Figure 2H , day 10 of onset, red arrow).

875,585093,"Although no RSV vaccine is available, two products have been approved for passive immunization against RSV infections: RSV immunoglobulin (RSV-IGIV), prepared from donors possessing high serum titers of RSV-neutralizing antibody, and palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the fusion protein of RSV [6, 7] . These effective treatments are expensive and usually given to atrisk infants during the winter months when RSV infection is more prevalent. However, seasonality may pose a problem in subtropical and tropical climates. Among Asian cities, Lee et al. [8] reported a biennial pattern of RSVrelated hospitalization in Taiwan, whereas a retrospective study of RSV cases in a PICU in Hong Kong did not identify any definite seasonality [5] . Our PICU study suggested younger age, bacterial co-infections, history of chronic lung disease, acyanotic heart disease, and neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., mental retardation, cerebral palsy, neuromuscular diseases) to be risk factors for severe RSV infection [5] . The medical costs for managing RSV-infected children with underlying diseases are high in our region [8] ; thus, any prophylactic measures against RSV are potentially cost-saving. Nonetheless, the above two options of RSV prophylaxis have not yet been introduced among public hospitals in Hong Kong, mainly due to the unavailability of data regarding their cost-effectiveness in southern Chinese children. Despite this, the local Hospital Authority approved the subsidization of palivizumab prophylaxis to high-risk groups from 2012. The aim of this study was to describe features of RSV-positive children who required PICU admission, as well as to identify factors associated with mortality and duration of PICU stay in Hong Kong before the introduction of RSV prophylaxis to the region."
876,639763,"Wheeze was common in this cohort, with only 35.4% of the children in the current study never wheezing during the first 5 years of life. An additional 34.3% were transient wheezers and 30.5% were late-onset or persistent wheezers. In contrast, Martinez et al 4 reported that 51.5% of their community-based cohort had never wheezed and those with late-onset wheezing and persistent wheeze were more likely to be atopic. The higher prevalence of lateonset and persistent wheeze in our study (compared with 28.7% for late-onset and persistent wheeze in the Tucson cohort) is not surprising as our children were selected on the basis of high genetic predisposition to atopy."
877,969401,"We estimated that mechanical ventilators could, in theory, prevent notable numbers of premature deaths among patients who become severely ill from pandemic influenza. The numbers of deaths averted greatly depended upon the actual scenario. For example, for a pandemic that caused (before any effective mitigation) a 20% CAR and relatively low rates of severity, mechanical ventilators could prevent a maximum of approximately 35 000 to 55 000 deaths. But, for the same attack rate, successful use of ventilators during a pandemic characterized as a high severity could prevent a maximum of 119 000 to 206 000 deaths. a Clinical attack rate refers to the percentage of the total population that becomes clinically ill due to pandemic influenza. Two levels of clinical severity were defined using case fatality rates (CFR), with ""low severity"" defined as having a range of CFR: 0.05%-0.1% and ""high severity"" having a CFR range of 0.25%-0.5% (Table 1) . b Deaths and hospitalizations calculated absent any interventions. c ICU, intensive care unit. d Ventilators at peak = demand for ventilators occurring at the peak of a pandemic. Because ventilators can be reused, this estimate reflects, for a given scenario, the maximum number of ventilators that may be needed at one time. Peak demand is defined as a combination of 2 elements: (i) Shape of epidemic-curve and (ii) duration of a patient on a ventilator. The results shown here were calculated assuming that peak demand was equivalent to 13% of total ventilated patients (Table 1 ). e Total deaths averted calculated as: Total number of patients in ICU requiring ventilation (at any time in pandemic) × (1-weighted average mortality in ventilated patients). See main text for details. f Deaths averted at peak calculated by multiplying ventilators need at peak demand by % survival (1-weighted average mortality. The latter taken from Table 2 ). See main text for explanation of how peak demand was calculated."
878,2592248,"In this study, hRV that were detected uniquely by the multiplex method (26 in the negative group and 15 in the positive group) are likely to be serotypes that are difficult or impossible to culture. However, only MRC5 and HuH7 cells were used for viral isolation technique, and the traditional cell lines, such as MDCK, HeLa R or NCI-H292 cells, were not used. This could explain the greater quantity of viruses that were found using the multiplex RT-PCR assay in relation to the cell cultures. The detection of hRV is considerably improved by the use of molecular biology techniques (Savolainen et al., 2003; Coiras et al., 2004; Gilbert et al., 1996) . A retrospective study carried out in Caen between 1998 and 2000 revealed 211 hRV infections in hospitalised children, 53% of which were identified by cell culture and 47% of which were identified only by RT-PCR (Guittet et al., 2003) . Nevertheless, it is important to point out that the detection of hRV in nasal aspirates may be associated with interpretation problems, given that this virus can persist for 2 weeks or longer after the acute phase (Jartti et al., 2004) . The multiplex RT-PCR1 was able to detect all the hMPV previously identified. Furthermore, a high proportion of hMPV was found in the negative group: 14/92, i.e., 15% of samples and nine others in the positive group. hMPV is responsible for 5-7% of viral respiratory tract infections in hospitalised children worldwide (Van Den Hoogen et al., 2004; Boivin et al., 2003; Freymuth et al., 2003a, b) . Until now hMPV was not targeted by any multiplex protocol. Its clinical impact and its prevalence fully justify its detection in routine diagnosis, alongside hRSV. Three type 4 PIV were detected by this method: one in the positive group and two in the negative group. It is very difficult to culture this serotype in vitro and immunofluorescence assay has only been possible for a short while, since the production of a first monoclonal anti-PIV-4 antibody. For these reasons PIV-4 is practically never sought in virology laboratories (Echevarria et al., 1998) . But it has been shown that it can cause bronchiolitis or pneumonia in young children and immunodepressed subjects and its prevalence appears to be higher than originally thought (Aguilar et al., 2000; Lindquist et al., 1997) . Three HCoV OC43 were detected by the multiplex PCR, two of which were positive with the cell culture method. The HCoV OC43, which are generally considered to cause colds, have been described to cause lower respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and bronchiolitis) in infants and the elderly . Given that few virology laboratories seek HCoV, it is probable that their pathogenic role is underestimated . The influenza C virus is generally considered to cause non-severe influenza. However, its pathogenic potential is not well known and its frequency is undoubtedly highly underestimated, as shown by the presence of anti-influenza C antibodies in a large proportion of the French population (Manuguerra et al., 1992) . GAPDH, transcribed by nasal mucous cells and used as an internal control in the multiplex RT-PCR, has the advantage of being always present in the sample. This internal control was used in multiplex 2 only, as it caused disturbances in amplifications results of the other RT-PCR multiplex assays and in the hemi-nested PCR multiplex 2. Theoretically, since those RT-PCR multiplex assays used the same amplification kit and the same extraction protocol, the amplification of GAPDH would be similar in the three RT-PCR assays."

880,921627,"Using macaque-specific microarrays, we were able to observe that with early infection, high levels of viral mRNA corresponded to a strong cellular host response. This strong host response is dominated by genes involved in the immune response and includes a wide range of genes corresponding with what is seen in human ARDS. During the acute phase of human ARDS, activated neutrophils and macrophages enter the alveoli and produce a number of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and CXCL10 (IP-10) [36] , as were found in the lungs of our SARS-CoV-infected macaques. Researchers have postulated that these genes also predict adverse SARS patient outcome [37] . During the chronic phase of human ARDS, type 2 pneumocytes start to proliferate and differentiate in order to repair the damaged lung. At day 4, [14, 38] . We also detected a strong presence of genes involved in the coagulation pathway, including TFPI2, SERPINE1, and TIMP1. The idea of a pro-coagulation profile mimics the clinical-pathological observations of SARS patients that showed unusually disseminated small vessel thromboses in the lungs [5, 39] . Additionally, cathepsin L was up-regulated in all SARS-CoV-infected macaques. Induction of this gene after SARS-CoV infection is quite interesting because cathepsin L is an endosomal protease that is necessary for SARS-CoV to infect a cell [35] ."

882,2759322,"Povidone iodine (PVP-I) has been known for a long time as a broad spectrum microbicide against bacteria, fungi, protozoans and viruses [13] . In a water-soluble complex, the elemental iodine is bound to the carrier polyvinylpyrrolidone. In an aqueous medium, a chemical equilibrium develops to release the active antimicrobial agent iodine, while the complex-linked iodine builds a reservoir for delivery [14] . Thereby, its microbicidal activity is maintained but the cytotoxic effects of high concentrations of iodine are reduced [14] . The oxidative potency of PVP-I enables the iodine released to react rapidly with functional groups of amino acids and nucleotides, as well as with double bonds of fatty acids, resulting in a manifold destruction of various structures and enzymes of microbes and viruses. The development of resistance mechanisms against the very broad oxidative attack appears almost impossible [13, 15] ."

There are many policies implemented since the first case of COVID-19 was found in Vietnam.

Studies so far suggest that diabetics, as well as subjects with obesity, are at a greater risk of hospitalization and increased complications from influenza (17, 18) . Compared with vaccinated healthy-weight adults, vaccinated obese adults have twice the risk of influenza or influenza-like illness despite equal serological response to vaccination (19) .

886,2826933,"More substantial levels of physical distancing (50%) would lead to far greater effects in the first 12 months of the epidemic. However, this strategy, unlike shielding, reduces overall transmission and thus does not necessarily result in a resolution of the epidemic through herd immunity during this period; instead, this intervention would need to be sustained into the second year until herd-immunity is reached through either natural immunity or a vaccine, assuming immunity is long lived. Supplemental Figure S3 illustrates this phenomenon: when all interventions except self-isolation are lifted after 12 months, scenarios where physical distancing has reduced transmission outside the household by 50% in the first year may feature a second, albeit smaller peak during the second year if no further mitigation measures are taken; this further peak is absent under the other strategies. However, predictions beyond the first year may vary considerably depending on the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 immunity and availability of potential pharmaceutical interventions, and should be interpreted with caution. 4"
887,2008010,"The best available strategy to prevent and control influenza is through influenza vaccination. In the United States, all persons ≥6 months of age are recommended to receive influenza vaccine annually. However, influenza vaccine effectiveness can vary from season to season, depending on the match between the vaccine influenza strains and the circulating strains and host factors. In addition, during influenza pandemics, the development and deployment of an influenza vaccine may be delayed. Influenza antiviral therapy for persons with severe influenza illness or who are at risk for complications is an important adjunct intervention to the influenza vaccination program, reducing morbidity and mortality during seasonal or pandemic influenza [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Nonetheless, there is always the possibility of widespread circulation of an influenza virus strain resistant to available antiviral agents, and, in a pandemic situation, the risk of antiviral shortages is ever present. The use of immune-modulating drugs, particularly statins, has been postulated as an additional tool for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza, especially in countries where influenza vaccine and antiviral agents are not readily available [13, 14] ."

Hospitals rapidly reduced scheduled clinical and surgical activities often until closure. Hub centers for neurosurgical emergencies have been settled in various ways [2] .

In this study we transferred MHV-4-specific T cell clones into infected mice and examined whether these T cell clones could protect mice from acute fatal encephalitis. Both types of T cell clones protected H-2-matched mice, accompanied by a significant inhibition of virus replication and clearance of viral antigen-positive cells in the CNS; however, the CTL clone was more active in terms of viral clearance. Thus, not only CD4 + Th but also CD8 + CTL can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the CNS."

892,6,"Health careeassociated MERS-CoV infections and outbreaks have been associated with high morbidity, high rates and prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, and fatality rates up to 65%. 2, 3, 23 Given the fact that health care services are often used by older people with comorbidities and in association with the severe course In the description of demographics of secondary MERS-CoV cases, a drop of the median age from 59 to 43 years old compared with primary cases has been reported. 21 This depends on the conditions of each outbreak and may be affected by the preponderance of affected HCWs in each instance. For example, in the most recent WHO report, 8 the HCWs who tested positive for MERS-CoV in the 2014 Jeddah outbreaks were more likely to be younger, women, and to exhibit mild or no symptoms compared with primary cases. However, 15% of HCWs developed a severe disease, which resulted in admission to an intensive care unit or death. 8 Unsuspected cases are the main source for the introduction of MERS-CoV virus from the community or another health care facility. 3 Although such patients may present with compatible symptoms, the diagnosis may not be considered early or symptoms may be mild. 2, 24, 33 In the hospital outbreak that occurred in Saudi Arabia in 2013, 3 patients exhibited no fever during initial presentation. 3 HCWs may acquire MERS-CoV infection either in the community or through occupational exposure. 2, 3, 32 Nurses are mostly affected, which is attributed to their prolonged, repeated, and closer physical contact with patients. HCWs may continue working despite being symptomatic. 6 An asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic course has been described in HCWs, 2, 8, 24 which raises the possibility of transmission of the infection to their vulnerable patients during an asymptomatic phase or early incubation. Patient-to-patient transmission has been noted as well. 3, 22 Currently, health careeassociated outbreaks are playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the MERS-CoV epidemic. 8 In the recent mission report by the WHO authorities evaluating data on 128 laboratory-confirmed cases in 14 hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with onset of symptoms between February 17 and April 26, 2014, one-third of the cases were considered to be primary cases (some of the investigations are still ongoing), whereas >60% of the cases (including 39 HCWs) were classified as hospital acquired. 8 In the rest of Saudi Arabia, 26 out of 127 (20.5%) recent cases were identified in HCWs. 8 Overall, 65 of the 290 (22.4%) cases reported from Saudi Arabia from March 27 to May 9, 2014, were HCWs. 23 In Mecca, another large outbreak in a hospital was described with 28 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 27 HCWs. 8 Both outbreaks were larger than the originally described outbreak in Saudi Arabia. 3 In the United Arab Emirates, HCWs accounted for more than twothirds of 37 cases reported during the same period. 8 Although the WHO points to infection control gaps for the recent propagation of MERS-CoV within health care facilities in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, we do not know if this concerns the use of personal protective equipment, hand hygiene, procedures, environmental cleaning, or triage."
893,1601586,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is an important cause of respiratory disease. The majority of studies addressing the importance of virus co-infections to the HRSV-disease have been based on the detection of HRSV by RT-PCR, which may not distinguish current replication from prolonged shedding of remnant RNA from previous HRSV infections. To assess whether co-detections of other common respiratory viruses are associated with increased severity of HRSV illnesses from patients who were shedding viable-HRSV, nasopharyngeal aspirates from children younger than 5 years who sought medical care for respiratory infections in Ribeirã o Preto (Brazil) were tested for HRSV by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR and virus isolation in cell culture. All samples with viable-HRSV were tested further by PCR for other respiratory viruses. HRSV-disease severity was assessed by a clinical score scale. A total of 266 samples from 247 children were collected and 111 (42%) were HRSV-positive. HRSV was isolated from 70 (63%), and 52 (74%) of them were positive for at least one additional virus. HRSV-positive diseases were more severe than HRSV-negative ones, but there was no difference in disease severity between patients with viable-HRSV and those HRSV-positives by RT-PCR. Co-detection of other viruses did not correlate with increased disease severity. HRSV isolation in cell culture does not seem to be superior to RT-PCR to distinguish infections associated with HRSV replication in studies of clinical impact of HRSV. A high rate of co-detection of other respiratory viruses was found in samples with viable-HRSV, but this was not associated with more severe HRSV infection. J. Med.

However, it is lower than the 69% rate reported by Llitjos et al. who performed a systematic screening with Doppler ultrasound [5] . As previously reported [2] , PE was the leading cause of thrombosis in our cohort. As there is a growing interest in chest CT scan as a diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [6] , performing a systematic pulmonary angiography may constitute a relevant strategy."
896,1476480,"Serologic tests that identify antibodies (such as IgA, IgM, and IgG) to SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens (such as blood or saliva), such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, may be less complex than molecular tests and have the potential to be used for diagnosis in certain situations (46) . However, their utility for diagnosing acute infections is probably limited around the time of symptom onset, when viral shedding and transmission risk seem to be highest (32) . Antibody responses to infection take days to weeks to be reliably (46) . Negative results would not exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly among those with recent exposure to the virus. Cross-reactivity of antibody to non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus proteins is also a potential problem, whereby positive results may be the result of past or present infection with other human coronaviruses (47) . Serologic assays might be more relevant in scenarios in which patients present to medical care with late complications of disease, when RT-PCR may be falsely negative, because viral shedding drops over time (48) . The development of serologic assays that accurately assess prior infection and immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for epidemiologic studies, ongoing surveillance, vaccine studies, and potentially for risk assessment of health care workers. Immunoassays are already on the market in some countries, but their diagnostic accuracy and optimal use remain undefined."
897,677844,"The quantitative result of our modified RT-PCR assay provided further information regarding to the viral load of SARS-CoV in these clinical specimens. Our results indicated that the viral load increases as the disease progresses. Of those samples that were negative in the first generation RT-PCR assay, all of these specimens contained very low amounts of viral RNA (Fig. 2b) . This observation explained why most of these samples were negative using our first generation RT-PCR assay. Interestingly, for those specimens that were positive in the first generation assay, some had very high amounts of viral RNA (Fig. 2) . Whether this observation has any clinical significance requires further investigation."
898,896746,"Also, in this study, a novel calicivirus was discovered in cats and characterized as a member of the Norovirus genus by sequence analysis of the complete genome. This novel feline calicivirus was detected in 6/14 samples collected from cats housed in a shelter in New York State (collection B) ( Table 1 ). These findings are in agreement with previous evidence that cats can be infected with NoVs [15, 16] . It is of relevance that animals from group B showed enteric symptoms and were young kittens almost of the same age (8 to 12 weeks old). This age period is critical for kittens, since maternally derived antibodies tend to wane and the animals become fully susceptible to various pathogens [32] . On the other hand, NoVs were not detected in animals from group A. This might reflect either geographic or temporal variations, age-related patterns of susceptibility or merely the relatively small number of samples included in the analysis."

All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH and carried out by certified staff in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International accredited facility, according to the institution's guidelines for animal use, and followed the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rhesus macaques were housed in adjacent individual primate cages allowing social interactions, in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light−dark cycle (12-h light/12-h dark). Animals were monitored at least twice daily throughout the experiment. Commercial monkey chow, treats, and fruit were provided twice daily by trained personnel. Water was available ad libitum. Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human interaction, commercial toys, videos, and music.

901,136383,"Because macaque monkeys have been used extensively as models for a wide variety of human diseases (and in AIDS research in particular), we have also taken on the challenge of developing genomic resources focused on macaque species. This effort has resulted in the sequencing of the rhesus macaque genome 13 and the development of an oligonucleotide microarray containing over 17,000 unique macaque sequences 14 16 . Our studies suggest that the lethality associated with the 1918 virus is a culmination of a cooperative interactions between the 1918 viral genes that results in a one-two blow to the host: an attenuation of the expression of specific innate immune response genes, including certain genes associated with the type I IFN response, followed by severe and persistent inflammatory and cell-death responses that may contribute to severe immunopathology. Indeed, these data suggest that the best treatment for such a virulent virus would be to combine an antiviral compound with existing anti-inflammatory drugs. Work in the laboratory of M.G.K. has also addressed a wide range of other viral pathogens, including HCV 17 , Ebola virus 18 , West Nile virus 19 , SARS-associated coronavirus 20 , HSV 21 and HIV 22 . The long-term goal is to assemble massive databases describing the host responses to multiple viral agents in multiple model systems. We believe that a careful dissection of these databases will reveal the secrets necessary to devise effective antiviral strategies against host cell processes. As microarray analysis measures gene expression only at the transcriptional level, we have also begun to incorporate other complementary approaches, such as proteomics and bioinformatics, to apply systems biology to the study of viral infections and virus-associated diseases 23, 24 . By collecting 'clinical' data on humans and animals, we hope to integrate genomic, proteomic and clinical datasets to enhance our ability to understand the underlying mechanisms of host defense and response to viral infection. This will be important in dissecting the impact of viral infection on host pathways and vice versa."
902,129324,"Early data to support the efficacy of various NPI measures in reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread has relied mostly on model-based analysis rather than empirical data derived from observations in the real world. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] As cases have accumulated around the world, it has become increasingly possible to retrospectively assess the impact of NPIs on measured outcomes, as presented in this study. Previous characterization of disease burden across research studies and news sources has largely relied on the metrics of cumulative case and death counts; however, these metrics are unidirectional and do not account for bidirectional changes in the rate of viral transmission over time, a much more powerful metric for predicting an epidemic's trajectory. In this study, we examine effective reproduction number (Rt) as the primary metric of disease burden, which describes the virus's transmission potential in real-time and can thus account for the impact of contextual changes in policy and behavior on disease spread."

Estimates of the extraction rate in the Congo Basin suggest that >282.3 g of bushmeat per person per day may be eaten there, with a total of 4.5 million tons of bushmeat extracted annually (17) . Expanded demand for bushmeat will likely lead to changes in the exposure of humans to potentially zoonotic microbes. Therefore, assessing the risk that bushmeat extraction and consumption poses to public health will include an assessment of the economy and geography of bushmeat demand and supply."

905,971258,"Several real-time PCR assays for respiratory pathogens have been published in recent years, including multiplex systems targeting the majority of respiratory viruses [Templeton et al., 2004; Watzinger et al., 2004; Gunson et al., 2005 Gunson et al., , 2006 van de Pol et al., 2007; Brittain-Long et al., 2008] . High-throughput systems combining PCR with fluid microbead multiplex product detection have also been recently described [Lee et al., 2007; Mahony et al., 2007] . However, most published assays have not been adapted for large-scale diagnostic use, or lack one or more important virus targets. This prompted the development of a real-time PCR platform for 15 viruses performed in 13 reactions. This diagnostic platform has fully replaced IF and virus isolation in the laboratory. The system was designed with emphasis on efficient handling in the laboratory, minimal hands-on work, short turn-around time, and the capacity to handle many samples during the influenza and RSV epidemic seasons. The primary objective was to expand the diagnostic panel, and at the same time retain or improve the diagnostic sensitivity for influenza, RSV, PIV, and AdV compared to IF. The secondary objective was to obtain a streamlined workflow in the laboratory for respiratory samples, and keep the turn-around time to a minimum. The performance of the real-time PCR assays was evaluated by comparing retrospectively the assays to previous results from IF and tissue culture isolation of 585 stored pediatric nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples."
906,1018208,"Nonstructural proteins forming the replication/transcription complex (RTC) are coded by the genomic mRNA, where two overlapping ORFs are found. The ORF1a encodes for polyprotein 1a (pp1a) cleaved by viral proteases into 11 nonstructural protein (nsp1-nsp11). The second (ORF1b) produces 5 additional nonstructural proteins (nsp12-16) upon processing by the viral proteases contained into polyprotein 1ab (pp1ab) (Fig. 1 ). ORF1ab is translated upon a À1 ribosomal frameshift inside ORF1a, implying that nsp12-nsp16 are produced at significantly lower levels than ORF1a-encoded products. The nsp12-nsp16 proteins and their known co-factors/partners are the subject of this review. In an attempt to document their potential as drug targets, we report the present state of the art on the enzymatic machinery formed by the SARS-CoV ORF1b-encoded nonstructural proteins."
907,1107761,"The furin abundance in other three human cell lines, Hep3B, HepG2 and HCT116, with varying susceptibilities to IBV was analyzed by Western blot. Once again, differential expression of furin in these cells was observed. Compared with the furin level in Huh7 (treated as 1), the relative furin abundances in these cells are Hep3B (0.6), HCT116 (0.13) and HepG2 (0.28), as determined by densitometry (Fig. 4c) . The data largely correlate with the permissiveness of these cell lines to productive IBV infection, with HepG2 cells as one exception, which was shown to have an intermediate level of furin. The reason why HepG2 cells could support efficient productive IBV infection but are with a relatively low furin abundance is currently unclear. It would point to the involvement of multiple host cell factors in either restriction or promotion of IBV infection and is worthy of further studies. H1299 cells were infected with H1299-p1, H1299-p5 and H1299-p20, respectively, and harvested at 0, 6, 10, 16, 24 and 36 h post-infection, respectively.

908,2270381,"Multi-species interactions are critical to understand in order to accurately model viral dynamics in bat populations. To date, there is evidence for filovirus infection in a total of 17 bat species for (Marburgvirus, Zaire ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, and Lloviu virus), but no currently known bat hosts for Bundibugyo, Sudan, or Tai Forest ebolavirus (Table 1) . Virus has only been detected via PCR and sequencing in 7 (41%) of these potential bat reservoir species, and some serological findings listed in Table 1 are sparse (e.g., only 2/679 Epomops franqueti seropositive for Marburg virus [77] . Multiple bat species could potentially act as reservoirs for Zaire ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, and Marburg virus, but only one host species is currently known for Lloviu virus (Table 1 ). Many of these species have overlapping geographic ranges, and have the potential (at a geographic, not necessarily ecological, scale) to interact and share pathogens (Figure 3 ). However, while either fragments of virus (PCR) or antibodies were detected in these hosts, their true role as reservoirs versus incidental hosts and the relative contribution of each species to interspecific host dynamics is currently unknown. Multiple circulating pathogens can also change within-host and within-population dynamics and could confer cross-species immunity [93] . For example, multiple divergent Marburgvirus strains circulate within a single roost of R. aegyptiacus [19, 28] . This poses interesting questions regarding how these pathogens interact, such as is there cross-immunity and do divergent viruses have the same infection dynamics? Though cross-reactivity is shown among ebolaviruses, it is unknown how this translates to immunity within the hosts [116] . Leroy et al. demonstrated numerous bats infected (detected by PCR) with similar Zaire ebolavirus species PCR fragments some years apart, but within the species, these short genomic fragments differed between species and collection time [1]. In both cases, multiple hosts and circulating pathogens can complicate our understanding of virus-host interactions and should be considered during study design [93] ."

Food habits and perceptions of good food points toward high risk of consumption of unhealthy diets even among food secure groups. People with obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia are observed to have more severe consequences of COVID-19 infection and if such persons have protein and micro nutrient deficiencies their ability to survive the infection is further reduced.

915,1163281,"Alternative explanations for the early linear growth phase other than saturated testing capacity could be considered. First, it could be the result of preferential testing for highly-suspicious samples leading to a bias in the positive rate among samples. Another possibility that could be invoked is the effect of interventions, e.g., containment, on epidemic growth. Finally, transmission driven by sporadic outbreaks/clusters might lead to linear growth. Furthermore, we also found that the trajectory of the epidemic in California, United States, started with a discontinuous increase from zero counts on 11th March, 2020, following an exponential growth ( fig. 1(G) ). This abrupt increase is probably the result of testing delays, reporting delays or difficulties in identifying COVID-19 cases during the early phase of the outbreak, a pattern that is also misleading to the public."

919,1628901,"The most obvious gene which is likely to be a key modifier of SARS pathomechanisms is the spike (S) protein gene. As known for other coronaviruses, it does not only affect viral pathogenesis by determining the target cell specificity but also by other mechanisms. In this respect, a single mutation in the S gene of MHV has significant effects on the viral virulence and tissue tropism [72] . Also, mutations in the S gene led to the emergence of the weakly virulent PRCV from the virulent enteric TGEV [73] . Further potentially important genes are the 'non-essential' ORFs which show a significant divergence between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. In this respect, it was reported that the civet cat coronavirus has a 29-nucleotide deletion leading to a fusion of two non-essential ORFs into one new ORF in the SARS-CoV [18] . It was shown that deletion mutants of 'non-essential' ORFs of the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) leads to a lower virulence without an impact on viral replication [74] . It has to be established if this also applies to 'non-essential' ORFs of SARS-CoV.

Another meta-analysis of single and multiple virus respiratory infections (influenza, RV, ADV, HMPV, coronavirus, bocavirus, PIV1-3) and severity of disease concluded that the influence of coinfection on disease severity remains unclear due to the heterogeneity of results [41] . .27"
921,1616013,"There is no emergency in a pandemic. Taking the time to 'don and doff' personal protective equipment (PPE) correctly protects our colleagues and us so that we can all continue to safely care for sick patients in the long term. 16 It has been argued that previous pandemic plans and their existing ethical guidance are often ill-equipped to anticipate and facilitate the navigation of unique ethical challenges that arise during infectious disease pandemics. 17 This uncertainty, for example, in the scale of anticipated patients and potential ventilator shortages during a pandemic, is difficult to anticipate. 17 To meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, professional societies, health care institutions, and hospital networks have set up local and 4 regional ethics committees and developed guidelines to help inform decision making for critically ill patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, professional societies, and public health or government officials. 15 It is critical to limit the risk of exposure within the team as well as plan for potential staffing shortages, as team members exposed to COVID-19 will need 14 days of quarantine before coming back to work. Health care facilities cannot inform healthcare workers (HCW) if any colleagues they work with have tested positive for COVID-19. Furthermore, not all HCWs who are ill with COVID-19 symptoms are tested."
922,2592251,"The studies that have revealed co-infections have tended to find that they are not a factor associated with severity. Brouard et al. (2000) studied samples from 202 newborns hospitalised for bronchiolitis and detected viral co-infection in 27% of them, with a predominance of hRSV (39%). The analysis of various clinical and radiological parameters in these children showed that viral co-infections are not associated with more severe forms (Brouard et al., 2000) . Other authors found no difference in the duration of hospitalisation or the intensity of clinical signs between co-infected children and those infected with only one virus (Maletzky et al., 1971; Portnoy et al., 1965) . In children, co-infections associating hRSV and influenza A virus, hRV or PIV are not associated with more severe signs than mono-infections, whereas hRSV-Adenovirus co-infections may be associated with a worse prognosis (Glezen et al., 1980; Meissner et al., 1984; Tristram et al., 1988; Valenti et al., 1982) . To date, the study of viral co-infections has not revealed any particular clinical impact, however most of the methods used have undoubtedly underestimated the proportion of co-infections, either due to lack of sensitivity (i.e., conventional methods) or because the panel of viruses sought was too restricted. It is probable that the use of a multiplex RT-PCR approach will give results that are closer to reality and provide interesting information on the existence of associated or successive infections, their role and their clinical, prognostic and epidemiological effects."
923,623950,"Recently, neutralizing human mAbs of MERS-CoV have also been reported. Ying et al. constructed a very large phage-displayed antibody Fab library by using B cells from the blood of 40 healthy donors (Ying et al., 2014) . By screening this library against recombinant MERS-CoV RBD, a panel of 12 human mAbs was identified. Three mAbs, m336, m337 and m338, which bound to the RBD with picomolar affinity, were selected for further characterization. Remarkably, all three RBD-specific mAbs exhibited exceptionally potent neutralizing activity. The mAbs neutralized pseudotyped MERS-CoV with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ), ranging from 0.005 to 0.017 g/ml (Table 1) . Particularly noteworthy, the most potent mAb, m336, inhibited >90% MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection (IC 90 ) at a concentration of 0.039 g/ml. Similarly, m336 showed the most potent live virus neutralizing activity, with an IC 50 of 0.07 g/ml (Table 1 ). The three mAbs competed with each other for binding to the MERS-CoV RBD, and all the IgG1s potently inhibited the binding of RBD to the sDPP4 receptor. Consistent with the neutralization results, m336 IgG1 was slightly more potent than either m337 or m338 in blocking the binding of RBD to the receptor. The IC 50 s of m336, m337, and m338 were 0.034, 0.044, and 0.041 g/ml, respectively. These results suggest that the mAbs neutralize MERS-CoV by competing with the host receptor DPP4 for binding to the virus and that they have overlapping epitopes. To further localize the mAb epitopes, a panel of RBD alaninescanning mutants was developed, and some key residues on RBD involved in the binding of mAbs were identified. Interestingly, the three RBD-specific mAbs possess overlapping, but distinct, epitopes, suggesting the possibility of a synergistic effect by using three mAbs in combination. Molecular modeling and docking of these RBD-specific mAbs with the MERS-CoV RBD further confirmed the epitopes identified from RBD alanine-scanning mutants and also indicated a possible dominant role of the heavy chain in the mAb paratopes. The extensive overlapping between the mAb epitopes and the receptor binding sites on RBD explains the exceptional neutralizing potency of these mAbs."
924,2927808,"The lack of proper tools to study bat species has hampered the progress of our understanding of the unique physiological attributes of bats (7, 13) and much of our knowledge has thus far been derived from transcriptomic and genomic studies (1, 14, (35) (36) (37) . Although generating bat specific antibodies remains the best option, this approach is time consuming and expensive (22, 38, 39) . Hence identifying cross-reactive antibodies allows for much quicker and cost-effective ways of studying bat immune cell populations. While identifying cross-reactive antibodies to study new species is a common approach (38, 40) , new methods such as computational design strategies to improve the affinity of antibodies have been employed to increase species crossreactivity of antibody candidates and could be exploited in the field of bat immunology (41) ."

927,1960435,"The ambiguity of which procedures and viruses require additional protective measures during AGMPs may lead to breaches in protocol. During many of the cited nosocomial transmission events, HCWs did not use proper eye or respiratory protection. Even when aware of the need for respiratory protection, HCWs may mistakenly wear surgical masks or unfitted N95 respirators, which do not provide proper protection. Additionally, HCWs may not have access to approprtiate PPE depending on the health-care environment. Therefore, while determining the risks of certain viruses and procedures is essential, communicating their respective precautions and providing resources is equally important. Likewise, proper patient triage and diagnosis are the first steps to ensuring that precautions are undertaken when performing AGMPs."
928,2075558,"Generally, all health workers should implement appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) regarding contact and droplet precautions based on recommendations by WHO [8] . For health workers in ICU, advanced protections are required during routine intensive care and airborne precautions are considered as airborne transmission may happen during aerosol-generating procedures. The implementation of PPE may be different by option in certain practices. In our experience, the most protective choices were made and the ""zero"" medical infection rate was treated as the top priority that all staff were equipped from head to toe. Compared to official recommendations, we selected some additional PPE during intensive care, such as an extra medical face mask outside the respirator, and both face shield and goggles (see Fig. 1 ). Additional PPE may increase the risk of sharp injuries and increase the difficulty of donning and doffing. To lower the incidence of adverse events, sequences of donning and doffing PPE were carefully developed based on the above selections through thorough group discussions and agreement was reached among the team."
929,2681222,"As the international community responds to SARS-CoV-2, public health authorities in humanitarian crises begin at a disadvantage to enact appropriate infection control to prevent transmission in healthcare settings, identify infectious cases, administer supportive care and novel treatments for the seriously ill, and trace contacts. These standard public health measures are particularly difficult to perform in humanitarian settings. For example, limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services represent a barrier to testing. Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain for such, is a challenge in all settings, exacerbated in complex humanitarian crises. Frequent displacement and limited contact information may prevent effective contact tracing. Finally, intractable structural challenges such as overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. Given these increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises should be viewed as a priority for national and international bodies that seek to combat this unfolding pandemic. Resources must be identified to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases."
930,3118854,"Faecal samples from 554 bovines randomly selected at 30 farms in Arag6n were examined to investigate the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections. C. parvum oocysts were identified by using the Ziehl-Neelsen modified technique in 109 (19.7%) bovines ranging from 3 days old to adults. Positive animals were found in 19 (63.3%) farms. As much as 44.4% of calves aged 3-4 days were infected, but infection rates peaked at 6-15 days of age (76.7%). Nevertheless, prevalence was also high in weanling calves aged 1.5-4 months (14%), fattening calves and heifers 4-24 months old (7.7%) and adults (17.8%). Diarrhoea was recorded in 78.6% of suckling and 29.4% of weanling calves infected by C. parvum, but it was only found to be statistically associated with infection in suckling calves (P < 0.01). All calves shedding moderate or many oocysts had diarrhoea, whereas asymptomatic infection was always correlated with few oocysts in faeces. Cryptosporidial infections were always asymptomatic in bovines older than 4 months. Giardia cysts were identified in 65 bovines (11.7%) from 16 (53.3%) of the farms surveyed. Infection rates were significantly higher in suckling (14.1%) and weanling calves (38%) than in bovines older than 4 months (2.2%) (P < 0.001). Diarrhoea was recorded in 45.5% of suckling and 10.9% of weanling calves infected by Giardia, but it was not found to be statistically associated with infection.

Our estimate of 20-30 median contacts being traced and tested per case in the manual tracing strategies we considered (Table 4) is reflected in the large scale testing being conducted per confirmed case in countries with a high estimated proportion of cases reported as of mid-April 2020, such as Australia (64 tests per case) and South Korea (52 tests per case) (26, 27) .

932,2915347,"We analyzed previously reported data describing monkeypox cases identified between 1980-1984 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) [1] . These data were collected in order to assess the potential of monkeypox to emerge as an endemic human pathogen in the wake of smallpox eradication. Contact tracing and subsequent analysis by epidemiological teams classified each identified cases as a primary case, arising from animal-to-human transmission, or a secondary case, arising from human-to-human transmission. The data set consists of 125 infection clusters [26, 27] . Most clusters contained just one primary case and thus constituted a single transmission chain. However nineteen of the clusters had overlapping transmission chains, because contact tracing revealed they contained more than one primary case."
933,3143635,"Humans who experience a primary dengue virus (DENV) infection develop antibodies that preferentially neutralize the homologous serotype responsible for infection. Affected individuals also generate cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous DENV serotypes, which are non-neutralizing. Dengue cross-reactive, non-neutralizing antibodies can enhance infection of Fc receptor bearing cells and, potentially, exacerbate disease. The actual binding sites of human antibody on the DENV particle are not well defined. We characterized the specificity and neutralization potency of polyclonal serum antibodies and memory B-cell derived monoclonal antibodies (hMAbs) from 2 individuals exposed to primary DENV infections. Most DENV-specific hMAbs were serotype cross-reactive and weakly neutralizing. Moreover, many hMAbs bound to the viral pre-membrane protein and other sites on the virus that were not preserved when the viral envelope protein was produced as a soluble, recombinant antigen (rE protein). Nonetheless, by modifying the screening procedure to detect rare antibodies that bound to rE, we were able to isolate and map human antibodies that strongly neutralized the homologous serotype of DENV. Our MAbs results indicate that, in these two individuals exposed to primary DENV infections, a small fraction of the total antibody response was responsible for virus neutralization."
934,1758897,"Spreading in time and space, rapidly evolving viruses can accumulate a considerable amount of genetic variation. As a consequence, viral genomes become valuable resources to reconstruct the spatial and temporal processes that are shaping epidemic or endemic dynamics. In molecular epidemiology, spatial inference is often limited to the interpretation of evolutionary histories with respect to the sampling locations of the pathogens. To test hypotheses about the spatial diffusion patterns of viruses, analytical techniques are required that enable us to reconstruct how viruses migrated in the past. Here, we develop a model to infer diffusion processes among discrete locations in timed evolutionary histories in a statistically efficient fashion. Applications to Avian Influenza A H5N1 and Rabies virus in Central and West African dogs demonstrate several advantages of simultaneously inferring spatial and temporal processes from gene sequences. quantification of uncertainty in both the ancestral state reconstructions and the underlying phylogeographic process. Further, as we are able to infer plausible root positions unlike the original analysis, we are not required to include outgroup sequences. To model sequence evolution, we employ the [29] (HKY85) CTMC model of nucleotide substitution; we include discrete gamma-distributed rate variation [30] and assume an unknown, constant population-size coalescent process prior over the unknown phylogeny [31] . Exploratory analyses using the less restrictive Bayesian skyline plot model indicate that the demographic prior has little influence on the phylogeographic inference (data not shown). Figure 1 summarizes the Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees for the A-H5N1 HA and NA segments. An MCC tree is a point-estimate characterizing the posterior distribution of trees and represents the tree topology yielding the highest product of individual clade probabilities in their posterior sample [2] ; branch lengths in these MCC trees are posterior median estimates."
935,606041,"Similar to SARS-CoV, during the infection process, the S protein of MERS-CoV is cleaved into a receptor-binding subunit S1 and a membrane-fusion subunit S2 [54] [55] [56] [57] . The MERS-CoV S1 subunit also includes an RBD, mediating the attachment between virus and target cells [54, 55, 58, 59] . Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV requires DPP4 (also known as CD26) as its cellular receptor [60, 61] but not ACE2. The RBDs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV differ, although they share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, explaining the different critical receptors noted above [57, 62] . The core subdomain of RBD is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, and includes a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and several connecting helices. The RBM comprises a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet for connecting to the core via loops [57, 62] . Two N-linked glycans, N410 and N487, are seated in the core and RBM, respectively. Particularly, the residues 484-567 of RBM take charge of interacting with the extracellular β-propeller domain of DPP4. The fusion core formation of MERS-CoV resembles that of SARS-CoV; however, it is different from that of other coronaviruses, such as the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and HCoV-NL63 [63] [64] [65] [66] ."

Very recently, a challenging clinical situation associated with chronic hepatitis E in immunocompromised individuals has emerged in some industrialized nations (Parvez, 2013) . Classified as the only member of the Hepeviridae family, HEV has at least four recognized genotypes.

938,1649251,"Coronaviruses infect many animals species, including cats and dogs. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was first recognized in 1963 at the Angell Memorial Animal Hospital in Boston by Holzworth [9] . A few years later, Ward discovered that the etiologic agent of this disease was a virus of the family Coronaviridae, that is, the feline coronavirus (FCoV) [10] . The first observation of canine coronavirus (CCoV) infection was reported in 1971, when Binn and colleagues isolated a coronavirus (strain 1-71) from dogs with acute enteritis in a military canine unit in Germany [11] . Since these discoveries, much knowledge has been gained as regarding the molecular biology and pathobiology of these viruses. This paper describes recent advances in knowledge of their genetic diversity, the determinants of pathogenesis, and their ability to cross the species barrier. Differences and similarities between these viruses have been highlighted. The paper focuses on feline and canine coronaviruses of the Alphacoronavirus genus, and leaves the canine respiratory coronavirus, which belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, aside (see below). divided into three new genera, Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus (formerly named group 1, 2 and 3, resp.) [14] . Each genus is subdivided into different species on the basis of sequence identity in the replicase domains of the polyprotein pp1ab. Representative members of each species are listed in Table 1 . The porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), canine coronavirus (CCoV), and feline coronavirus (FCoV) display greater than 96% sequence identity within the replicase polyprotein pp1ab, and for this reason have been grouped in the same species, alphacoronavirus 1, within the Alphacoronavirus genus [14] (Table 1) . Both the ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) and the ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) also belong to the Alphacoronavirus genus [15] . Recently, the genome of the mink coronavirus (MCoV), the etiological agent of catarrhal gastoenteritis in mink, has been completely sequenced and shows close genetic relationship with FRECV and FRSCV.

Among these COVID-19 patients, most of them have the common symptoms including fever, cough, and myalgia or fatigue at onset. The majority of patients can recover, however, about 25% of patients will progress into severe complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may worsen rapidly into respiratory failure, need an intensive care unit (ICU) and even cause multiple organ failure [4, 5] .

940,3030386,"The epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Bats of several species in southern People's Republic of China harbor SARS-like CoVs and may be reservoir hosts for them. To determine whether bats in North America also harbor coronaviruses, we used reverse transcription-PCR to detect coronavirus RNA in bats. We found coronavirus RNA in 6 of 28 fecal specimens from bats of 2 of 7 species tested. The prevalence of viral RNA shedding was high: 17% in Eptesicus fuscus and 50% in Myotis occultus. Sequence analysis of a 440-bp amplicon in gene 1b showed that these Rocky Mountain bat coronaviruses formed 3 clusters in phylogenetic group 1 that were distinct from group 1 coronaviruses of Asian bats. Because of the potential for bat coronaviruses to cause disease in humans and animals, further surveillance and characterization of bat coronaviruses in North America are needed."

942,2344186,"Members of the Flavivirus genus, such as DENV, West Nile virus (WNV) and yellow fever virus (YFV), are mosquito-borne enveloped RNA viruses that cause various medically relevant human diseases, including haemorrhagic fever and encephalitis 46 . It was recently shown that ectopic expression of either TIM receptors (TIM1, TIM3 (also known as HAVR2) and TIM4 (also known as TIMD4)) or TAM receptors (AXL and TYRO3) enhanced flavivirus endocytosis through CME (A.A., unpublished observations) (FIG. 1) and that subsequent infection by all DENV serotypes, WNV and YFV was Figure 1 | Classic apoptotic mimicry. During classic apoptotic mimicry, a virus acquires host cell phosphatidylserine and incorporates it into the viral membrane. Exposed phosphatidylserine on the viral surface binds directly or indirectly to phosphatidylserine receptors, which facilitate virus entry or infection. Shown are several potential strategies that viruses may use to acquire phosphatidylserine in their membranes during assembly. Ebola virus (EBOV) has been shown to bud from plasma membrane microdomains, or lipid rafts, that are highly enriched for phosphatidylserine in the external leaflet. Furthermore, it has been proposed that vaccinia virus (VACV), which acquires its membrane within the host cytoplasm and exits host cells by inducing cell lysis, derives its membrane from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) sheets generated by the rupture of ER cisternae. Finally, dengue virus (DENV) and other flaviviruses derive their membrane via ER budding. Although these examples cover a range of mechanisms, it is also possible that phosphatidylserine enrichment is facilitated by the viral modulation of lipid flippases or of apoptosis (not illustrated). Recent evidence indicates that phosphatidylserine exposed on the viral surface binds to both direct phosphatidylserine receptors, such as T cell immunoglobulin and mucin receptor (TIM) proteins, and indirect phosphatidylserine receptors, such as AXL and tyrosine protein kinase receptor 3 (TYRO3), which require phosphatidylserine-bridging molecules. Both EBOV and DENV have been shown to use both direct and indirect phosphatidylserine receptors, whereas VACV has only been shown to use the indirect receptor AXL. Whether EBOV and DENV can engage these various receptors simultaneously or whether VACV can use other phosphatidylserine receptors has not been determined. For some viruses, such as EBOV and VACV, engagement of phosphatidylserine receptors triggers their internalization by macropinocytosis. For other viruses, including DENV, binding of phosphatidylserine to receptors on the host cell surface induces clathrinmediated uptake, which is an alternative mechanism of endocytosis. After internalization, downstream signalling cascades promote additional steps of infection. 14, 15, 17 . Moreover, it was shown that phosphatidylserine is incorporated into the membrane of flavivirus particles and is essential for infection of TIM-or TAMexpressing cells, suggesting that flaviviruses use apoptotic mimicry to invade host cells. Characterization of the interactions revealed that virions bind directly to the TIM receptors TIM1 and TIM4 and require the metal ion-dependent ligand-binding site in these receptors. By contrast, binding of TAM receptors occurred indirectly via the bridging molecules GAS6 or protein S (PROS). These data strongly argue for a tripartite model, whereby TAM ligands bind to phosphatidylserine exposed on DENV particles and bridge virions to TAM receptors. Collectively, these studies suggest that viruses which use classic apoptotic mimicry to enter cells undergo macropinocytosis or CME. Currently, no clear pattern linking the choice of endocytic mechanism to receptor preference can be delineated, nor can alternative endocytic mechanisms be ruled out. For viruses using CME, many of the studies are gain-of-function assays performed in non-permissive cell lines; therefore, additional experimental evidence is needed to determine whether phosphatidylserine receptor engagement by enveloped viruses is required for CME. Thus, it may be important to reinvestigate the endocytic mechanism of virus internalization in the context of apoptotic mimicry."
943,303178,"Classification beta-CoV beta-CoV beta-CoV In several studies a similar prevalence in the detection of HCoVs in patients with respiratory symptoms compared to healthy children has been found. [36] [37] [38] [39] Moreover, patients with other underlying medical conditions or immunocompromised appear more susceptible to developing severe infections than healthy patients. [40] [41] [42] [43] Additionally, human coronaviruses are responsible for other common childhood diseases such as acute otitis media [44] [45] [46] [47] , asthma exacerbations 48, and conjunctivitis 8 . They have also been involved in nosocomial infections, especially in the neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Gagneur et al. in a prospective study determined the incidence of HCoVrelated respiratory infections in newborns hospitalized in a NICU. Among 64 neonates, seven positive nasal samples for HCoVs (11%) were detected. All children were symptomatic. Oxygen and ventilatory support were frequently needed. 49 Sizun et al. evaluated the clinical role of coronaviruses respiratory infections in premature newborns. All premature infants infected had severe respiratory symptoms, including bradycardia, apnea, and hypoxemia, while chest X-ray revealed diffuse infiltrates. 50 It has also been shown that coronavirus infections are not only responsible for respiratory symptoms but can also affect other organs and systems in children. Several studies have also reported that respiratory symptoms caused by coronavirus infection may be associated with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. HCoVs have an intrinsic capacity to affect neurons and diffuse centrifugally from CNS via the transneuronal route. 51, 52 Among neurological symptoms, febrile seizures, convulsions, loss of consciousness, encephalomyelitis, and encephalitis have been reported. [53] [54] [55] Primarily in 1980, the viral genome was detected post-mortem in the cerebrospinal fluid of two patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). 56 Subsequently, the HCoVs neuroinvasion capacity was confirmed in a large panel of human brain autopsy samples affected by MS and other neurological diseases. 57 58 In 2017, a prospective study on 192 children with febrile seizures demonstrated that coronaviruses were frequently detected. 59 Additionally, HCoVs have been implicated as possible causes of many gastrointestinal disorders in children, and gastrointestinal symptoms have been reported in several studies in more than 50% of pediatric patients 28, 60, 61 . Firstly, HCoVs could be associated with neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis 62 all HCoVs can also be detected in stool samples of patients affected by gastroenteritis. 60, 66 Moreover, most of the HCoVs found were coinfections with well-known gastroenteric viruses, including norovirus and rotavirus. HCoVs may also be found occasionally in healthy children's stool samples. 67 Although HCoVs have always been associated with respiratory symptoms, these findings suggest that other systems may also be involved in children. The absence of serious symptoms may not be coupled with serological negativity. Therefore, these viruses should be considered in the differential diagnoses of most of the common diseases of childhood."
944,1895213,"PCR assays for infectious disease range from the relatively simple, in which a pathogen is identified by the detection of a single positive amplification product, to multiplex assays for groups of pathogens [18] . Multiplex PCR allows the potential amplification of many nucleic acid targets within a single reaction [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] , and in theory is an ideal method for multi-pathogen detection. However, multiplex PCR has several practical limitations. Non-specific products generated through primer-primer interactions interfere with amplification of the actual targets and decrease sensitivity. In addition, as more true targets are amplified, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish the amplification products, although both bead-array and microchips have been used to accomplish this [29, 30, 31, 32, 33] . These constraints have limited the ability of multiplex PCR to interrogate a large number of targets, and reports of more than 8-deep multiplexing are uncommon [34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40] ."

Unlike in viral hepatitis, 11 histological outcomes are not known to be valid surrogate outcomes in the assessment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. After all, the ultimate aim is not to change histology but to prevent the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this respect, results of recent longitudinal studies 12, 13 showed that fi brosis, but not other histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, correlated with overall and disease-specifi c mortality. Fibrosis progression can also occur in patients with NAFLD who do not have steatohepatitis, albeit at a slower rate. 14, 15 These outcomes highlight the urgent need to defi ne reliable surrogate outcomes for the disorder. Until the time comes when there are robust surrogate outcomes for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, the follow-up of treated patients for long-term clinical outcomes will be very important."
946,1980887,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped and single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family (Murphy et al., 1999; Egberink et al., 1988) . The envelope contains three main viral proteins, spike (S, 180-220 kDa), membrane (M, 27-32 kDa) and small membrane(sM, 7 kDa) (Locker et al., 1992; Sang-Geon et al., 2003) . The M protein is the most abundant of three, it is a triple-spanning membrane protein with a short amino-terminal domain on the outside of the virus (the exterior of the viral envelope) and a long carboxyterminal domain on the inside (Utiger et al., 1995a) . Except playing an important role in the assembly process of viral nucleocapsid and membrane, M can neutralize anti-M antibody with the presence of complement (Rottier, 1995; de Haan et al., 1998) .

A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official websites and announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 AM 26 January 2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019-nCoV and the current outbreak was drawn. Up to 24 PM, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of 2019-nCoV infection were confirmed in mainland China with a total of 56 deaths having occurred. The latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 cases still suspected. The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up to 24 PM, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median age of the people who died was 75 (range 48-89) years. Fever (64.7%) and cough (52.9%) were the most common first symptoms among those who died. The median number of days from the occurence of the first symptom to death was 14.0 (range 6-41) days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 70 years or more (11.5 [range 6-19] days) than those aged less than 70 years (20 [range 10-41] days; P = .033). The 2019-nCoV infection is spreading and its incidence is increasing nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in elderly people, among whom the disease might progress faster.

With neither treatment nor vaccines, and without pre-existing immunity, the effect might be devastating because of the multiple health challenges the continent already faces: rapid population growth and increased movement of people; existing endemic diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria; remerging and emerging infectious pathogens such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa haemorrhagic fever, and others; and increasing incidence of non-communicable diseases."
951,1215328,"Overall, in children up to 3 years, hMPV infections represented about 11% of all viral illness, a value slightly lower than that (13.1%) reported recently in Northern Italy . In this study in Rome, only hMPV type A was detected, in contrast to the report that identified both types in the winter-spring season . In this study population, hMPV cases occurred in two peaks of infections, the former in winter and the latter in June; interestingly, in winter they were associated with bronchiolitis (children younger than 6 months), whereas in June with pneumonia (patients 6 months to 3 years old). Human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E are considered agents of upper respiratory tract diseases, including common cold; nonetheless, they are reported to cause more serious respiratory illnesses in children below the age of 1 year. In our coronavirus cases caused by OC43 serotype, five were affected with pneumonia and one with laryngitis, and patients were more than 1 year old. The child infected with NL63, hospitalized for acute respiratory infection, had a subsequent clinical diagnosis that met some criteria for attribution to Kawasaki disease. Obviously, only one case cannot contribute to the association of NL63 infection with Kawasaki disease [Esper et al., 2005b; Shimizu et al., 2005] ; in any case, this report confirms the circulation of NL63 in Italy, first reported when this manuscript was in preparation in Northern Italy, where it was detected only in the winter-spring season of 2004-2005. It is well known that infants with severe bronchiolitis have an increased risk of developing recurrent wheezing later in life and viruses other than RSV and multiple viral infections may contribute to the severity of bronchiolitis. It was reported [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Semple et al., 2005 ] that dual infections with hMPV and RSV, or rhinovirus and RSV, confer a 5-to 10-fold increase of severe disease in children admitted to pediatric intensive care units. In contrast, other studies reported that co-infection with two respiratory viruses were not significantly associated with disease severity [van Woensel et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2006 ]. In the present study, dual infections were detected in 10% of virus-positive cases, mainly in children with pneumonia. Clinical data available from co-infected children did not show significant differences from other patients. Larger studies are needed to clarify the issue whether multiple infections could be involved with the severity of low respiratory tract infections."

953,1002652,"RBD, a fragment (≈193 aa residues) in the middle of S1 subunit of S protein ( Figure 2B ), is responsible for virus binding to the receptor on target cells. We have demonstrated that the antisera from SARS patients and from animals immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV reacted strongly with RBD (9, 35) . Absorption of antibodies by RBD from these antisera results in the removal of most of the neutralizing antibodies, and RBD-specific antibodies isolated from these antisera have potent neutralizing activity (35, 36) . We have also shown that rabbits and mice immunized with RBD produced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV with 50% neutralizing titers at a >1:10,000 serum dilution (37) . The immunized mice were protected from SARS-CoV challenge (unpub. data). The antibodies purified from the antisera against SARS-CoV significantly inhibited RBD binding to ACE2 (9, (36) (37) (38) . Using spleen cells from mice immunized with RBD, we have generated a panel of 25 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize different conformational epitopes on RBD and possess potent neutralizing activity (38) . Our result is in agreement with the report by van den Brink et al. (39) , who identified 3 human neutralizing anti-S MAbs from antibody phage display libraries by using inactivated SARS-CoV as the target. These researchers also found that all of these MAbs specifically bound to RBD and blocked interaction between RBD and ACE2. These findings suggest that RBD contains the major neutralizing epitopes in the S protein and is an ideal SARS vaccine candidate because RBD contains the receptor-binding site, which is critical for virus attachment to the target cell for infection (15, (17) (18) (19) . Antibodies specific for RBD are expected to block binding of virus to the target cell. RBD induces higher titers of neutralizing antibodies than those vaccines expressing the full-length S protein (25, 26, 29, 30, 37, 38) . RBD sequences among the late SARS-CoV strains are highly conserved. When the early and late SARS-CoV strains are compared, only 3 to 5 aa residues are variable among the 193 residues in RBD and most of the isolates vary by only 1 residue (4). van den Brink et al. (39) showed that 1 human MAb (CR3014) specific for RBD of SARS-CoV strain FM1 can effectively bind to most RBDs of the early and late SARS-CoV strains. These data suggest that antibodies directed against RBD of a SARS-CoV isolate may neutralize infection by a broad spectrum of SARS-CoV strains. Therefore, recombinant proteins containing RBD or vectors encoding RBD may be used as vaccines for preventing infection by SARS-CoV with distinct genotypes."
954,1973227,"Among the respiratory animal coronaviruses, FCoV and PHEV have been associated with neurological diseases. Neurological symptoms may occur in cats infected with a highly virulent FCoV variant, designated FIPV [52, 53] . Neurological disease appears partially immune-mediated and may result in uncontrolled secretion of cytokines [54] that leads to diverse pathological manifestations including meningitis [55] and even spinal cord involvement [56] . Furthermore, there is often a small amount of infectious FCoV present in brain tissue [52] . The PHEV was isolated from the brains of suckling pigs suffering from encephalomyelitis several years ago in Canada [57] and the disease could be reproduced experimentally in piglets following intranasal inoculation [58] . After oronasal infection, it was shown that the virus first infects epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and small intestine and, using retrograde neuronal spreading via peripheral nerves, was able to enter the CNS [59] . More recently, the neuroinvasiveness and neurotropism of the virus were again demonstrated in a murine model, where PHEV induced a poor inflammatory reaction in the CNS and infected cells showed no cytopathological changes [60] ."
955,855876,"Crystallographic studies on coronavirus M pro prior to and during the SARS outbreak My group had started working on the coronavirus M pro around 1999. At that time, not a single crystal structure of a coronavirus protein had been determined. We first elucidated the crystal structure of the M pro of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus that is fatal for young piglets. Published in 2002 [29] , the structure revealed that the M pro is a dimer (cf. Fig. 2 ) in which the N-terminus (the 'N-finger') of one monomer helps shape the S1 substrate-specificity pocket and the oxyanion hole of the other monomer; hence, dimerization is a prerequisite for catalytic activity. It also revealed the presence of an a-helical domain (domain III) in addition to domains I and II, which together feature a chymotrypsin-like fold and harbor the catalytic Cys. . .His dyad between them. Subsequently, we synthesized a chloromethylketone inhibitor and cocrystallized it with the TGEV M pro in order to visualize the substrate-binding site in detail [30] . At the same time, we also determined the structure of the M pro of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV 229E). When SARS-CoV was identified and sequenced in the spring of 2003, we built the first homology model of the SARS-CoV M pro on the basis of the structure of the enzyme from HCoV 229E [30] . We further suggested, on the basis of the binding mode of our chloromethylketone inhibitor, that the Michael acceptor compound AG7088 (rupintrivir), which was being developed by Pfizer as an inhibitor of the 3C protease of human rhinovirus [31] , should be a good starting point for anti-SARS drug design [30, 32] . Later, this compound turned out not to have particularly high activity against SARS-CoV in cell culture, but derivatives of this Michael acceptor lead turned out to exhibit good anti-coronaviral activity in vitro and ex vivo [33] [34] [35] . Towards the end of the SARS outbreak in Beijing (in June 2003), the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV main protease itself was determined through a collaboration between the group of Zihe Rao in Beijing, who had recombinantly produced and crystallized the enzyme, and my group, both as the free protease ( Fig. 2 ) and in complex with the chloromethylketone inhibitor that we had already used for the TGEV M pro [36] .

956,1036153,"Currently, diagnostic tests are mostly limited to sequence amplification techniques as the CoVs have a restricted host range and are fastidious to propagate in cell culture. The clinical relevance of serological methods, mainly based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, is limited, since they are generally time-consuming. A variety of assays for detection of CoV have been developed to obtain more sensitive and rapid diagnostic results, such as reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (Vabret et al., 2001) , nested RT-PCR (Myint et al., 1994) and, recently, also real-time RT-PCR (van Elden et al., 2004) .

The virus spread mainly though the respiratory pathway via direct or intimate contact with excretions or secretions from infected birds [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .

965,1873183,"Laura Marandino a, *, Massimo Di Maio b , Giuseppe Procopio a , Saverio Cinieri c , Giordano Domenico Beretta d , Andrea Necchi a The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suddenly revolutionized the way we take care of patients with cancer. This situation was dramatically felt in geographic regions where the spread of the infection, qualified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, was causing an emergency health care situation. After the original outbreak in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, the infection rapidly spread throughout the world in more than 199 countries (www.worldometers.info/coronavirus). At the time of writing, Italy, and the Lombardy region in particular, was ranked first in terms of COVID-19-associated deaths, making this region one of the most critical hotspots of the COVID-19 outbreak [1] . In Italy, a total of 10 779 deaths had been reported by the health care authorities and 3906 patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admittance at the time of writing. Patients diagnosed with cancer have a higher risk of developing serious complications and dying from COVID-19 [2, 3] . Besides this consideration, a number of critical dilemmas have emerged regarding indications for cancer therapies and management of associated side effects. General clinical recommendations for patients with genitourinary cancers have already been published, obviously biased by the lack of actual data for most of the guidelines [4] . It is important to anticipate the shifting landscape that will probably occur in the management of patients with cancer to better prepare health care providers and systems for future needs. In March 2020 we therefore carried out a nationwide survey among Italian medical oncologists that focused on the management of patients with genitourinary malignancies. The survey was endorsed by and conducted through the Associazione Italiana di Oncologia Medica (AIOM) network, and took the form of an online questionnaire sent to all AIOM members. A total of 72 physicians provided feedback; their general characteristics are shown in Supplementary Table 1 . The questions and corresponding results are shown in Figure 1 . In general, there was consensus among oncologists to pursue treatment, possibly without delays or interruptions, for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease for which an induction or first-line therapy option is indicated in guidelines, particularly for patients suffering from prognostically aggressive disease requiring timely treatment (Fig. 1A-H) . A higher proportion of physicians were willing to consider delays or interruption for clinical settings characterized by more indolent disease or treatments associated, on average, with clinical benefit of lower magnitude. Of note, despite the public health care emergency, Italian oncologists were still in favor of close adherence to guidelines regarding administration of perioperative therapies, such as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with clinical T3-4N0M0 urothelial bladder cancer (Fig. 1C,D) and adjuvant therapy in high-risk, clinical stage I germ-cell tumors (Fig. 1F,G) . Overall, although the main factor taken into account for treatment decisions was its proven survival benefit, the number of hospital visits ranked second, ahead of other factors usually considered important in clinical decisions. Lastly, two important notions emerged from this survey. First, Italian oncologists are still in favor of considering delivery of the best treatment option for genitourinary cancer patients through inclusion in clinical trials (61%), although most of them (54%) underlined the unavoidable more stringent selection and the need to face severe logistic difficulties, as indicated in Fig. 1I . Second, although the risks associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in the present pandemic context are not well defined, most of the respondents would justify interruption of therapy only after case-by-case discussions with patients with a sustained response during treatment, or would consider skipping some doses to reduce the number of hospital visits (Fig. 1M) . Implementation of telemedicine will be critical in managing follow-up visits and oral drug delivery, as is currently done in several institutions nationwide. This survey provides a snapshot of the opinion of Italian oncologists regarding the management of patients with genitourinary malignancies. Similar considerations would probably apply to other solid tumors. In our opinion, the main message is that in spite of huge sudden changes in a geographic area representing an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic, oncologists are still determined to achieving treatment delivery as close as possible to clinical guidelines or routine clinical practice, at least for treatments supported by evidence of a clinically relevant gain in life expectancy. In the setting of advanced disease without curative intent, a non-negligible number of oncologists would delay treatment initiation (or consider interruption) in the second or further lines of treatment associated with a lower clinical benefit. For patients who deserve a systemic treatment with curative intent, we should still rely on the multidisciplinary approach among several other specialists. This continuing collaboration will require profound organizational changes, primarily related to the obvious delays in biopsies or radical surgical interventions that were promptly outlined by Italian urologists [5] ."
966,1111209,"The use of oxygen and BIPAP ventilation among patients with infectious respiratory diseases has been a subject of debate since the emergence of SARS in 2003. The high flow-rate of oxygen or air and/or the positive pressure resulting from such treatment procedures might accentuate the spread of potentially infectious air exhaled or expelled from patients [20] . In our recent study of airflow around oxygen masks during oxygen therapy, exhaled air from the mask can travel up to 0.4 m on each side of the patient [29] . In the present study, both the use of oxygen therapy and BIPAP ventilation imposed a significant risk for nosocomial spread of SARS in the final combined model (cutoff value, 3 cases), and use of oxygen therapy also significantly increased the risk in models with higher cutoff values. We did not have enough details about oxygen therapy modalities given to the index patients to allow a more refined analysis regarding the types of masks or cannulae and flow rate of oxygen supply in this study. Proper capturing (enclosure, containment, and local exhaust) and filtering (high-efficiency particulate air filter) of exhaled or expelled air should be imple- mented if oxygen and BIPAP ventilation must be used for clinical reasons. The mechanical maneuvers and procedures associated with resuscitation can generate large amounts of aerosols that are potentially infectious, especially during intubation of the airway and manual ventilation. More thought should be given to redesigning the procedures by engineering or administrative means to achieve effective containment of any possible contamination arising from the resuscitation process [30] ."

Selection of an entry receptor is governed by precise interactions that mediate efficient virus attachment to the cell surface as well as productive cell infection. Viruses can use a large number of cell surface molecules to penetrate host cells (Backovic and Rey, 2012) ; these molecules are the main determinants of virus tropism and pathogenesis. Receptor-binding motifs in viruses are subject to changes promoted by immune surveillance, which can target key receptor-binding residues during neutralization of virus infection. It is thus relatively common that a virus evolves to use distinct cell entry receptors over the course of an infection, or that related viruses use different cell surface molecules for host cell entry (Stehle and Casasnovas, 2009) . This is the case of coronavirus (CoV), whose use of distinct entry receptor molecules is responsible for their broad host range and tissue tropism (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001; Masters, 2006) . Some CoV have remarkable capacity for cross-species transmission which is linked to virus Fig. 1 . The CoV S glycoprotein and CoV cell surface receptors. Scheme of a CoV S with the functional domains in the S1 and S2 regions, which are exposed in the virus envelope. The N-terminal signal peptide (SP) and the transmembrane region (TM) are also shown. The N-terminal domain (NTD) that can act as a receptor-binding domain (N-RBD) and the canonical CoV RBD in the C-terminal portion of S1 are indicated. The heptad repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) and the putative fusion peptide (FP) are marked in S2. The arrowhead indicates the putative protease cleavage site in some CoV. Cell entry receptor molecules identified for the indicated CoV (Belouzard et al., 2012) are shown beneath their respective RBD regions. Sialic acids recognized by TGEV and IBV should be considered attachment factors. et al., 2003) . S2 contains the fusion peptide and two conserved heptad repeat regions, HR1 (N-terminal) and HR2 (C-terminal) ( Fig. 1) , which form a coiled coil structure important for S trimerization and the fusion reaction during CoV cell entry (Supekar et al., 2004; Xu et al., 2004) . The fusion peptide is N-terminal from the HR1 in the S2 sequence ( Fig. 1 ), but the HR1-HR2 coiled coil structure places it close to the transmembrane region. As in other enveloped viruses, the initiation of the fusion reaction requires partial disassembly of the trimeric spikes and the exposure of the fusion peptide for binding to the host cell membrane (Belouzard et al., 2012; Beniac et al., 2007; Harrison, 2005) . In some MHV variants and in the SARS-CoV, the S protein is processed into S1 and S2 fragments by cell proteases, which facilitate the fusion process and cell entry (Belouzard et al., 2012; Glowacka et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2006) . The S of alpha-CoV is not processed. Receptor-mediated endocytosis and exposure to low pH is a necessary step for entry of TGEV, hCoV-229E and SARS-CoV (Masters, 2006) . Other CoV, such as MHV and hCoV-NL63, do not require a low pH step for fusion, and the entry processes is mediated by receptor binding on the cell surface (Huang et al., 2006; Sturman et al., 1990) . CoV can thus follow different entry pathways to penetrate host cells (Belouzard et al., 2012) ; receptor, low pH and proteases are three major inducers of membrane fusion, and CoV use them differentially for cell entry. Mutations in the S1 and S2 fragments indicate that differences among CoV entry routes are probably related to variations in S trimer stability (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . Nonetheless, the conformational changes in the CoV S that lead to membrane fusion and cell entry have not been defined."
969,3044463,"The main route of transmission of SARS CoV infection is presumed to be respiratory droplets. However the virus is also detectable in other body fluids and excreta. The stability of the virus at different temperatures and relative humidity on smooth surfaces were studied. The dried virus on smooth surfaces retained its viability for over 5 days at temperatures of 22-25 • C and relative humidity of 40-50%, that is, typical air-conditioned environments. However, virus viability was rapidly lost (>3 log 10 ) at higher temperatures and higher relative humidity (e.g., 38 • C, and relative humidity of >95%). The better stability of SARS coronavirus at low temperature and low humidity environment may facilitate its transmission in community in subtropical area (such as Hong Kong) during the spring and in air-conditioned environments. It may also explain why some Asian countries in tropical area (such as Malaysia, Indonesia or Thailand) with high temperature and high relative humidity environment did not have major community outbreaks of SARS."
970,2815270,"SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome contains open reading frames (ORFs) for several accessory proteins without sequence similarity to known coronavirus proteins. These include 3a (originally called X1 or ORF3), 3b (X2 or ORF4), 6 (X3 or ORF7), 7a (X4 or ORF8), and 8b (X5 or ORF11) [6] [7] [8] . Here, we investigated whether these accessory gene products of SARS-CoV were able to induce inflammatory responses."
971,985941,"Coronavirus is one of the most important common human and animal pathogens [1] . In December 2019, new coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in China. It spreaded rapidly in China and worldwide within a short time [1] . It is now referred to as Coronavirus disease . It is a highly contagious [2] . The disease is secondary to the coronavirus b family; it has already led to severe epidemics, including SARS-CoV (Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus). The mortality rate of SARS-CoV was about 10% and MERS-CoV was up to 37%. Over the past two decades, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have resulted in more than 10,000 deaths [3, 4] . Some articles have considered pregnant women as a high-risk group of COVID-19 [5] . But the latest data in UptoDate suggest that pregnancy is not an additional risk factor for the infection, and the risk of disease, treatment and prognosis is similar to that of nonpregnants [1] . There is currently no information on foetal maternal or vertical transmission [5] . Although the COVID-19 can affect all age groups, the disease is usually milder in children than in adults, and may be accompanied by non-specific symptoms, especially in neonates [6] . The presentation of COVID-19 in children and neonate can range from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory distress [6] . The most common clinical symptoms include fever, fatigue and dry cough. Some patients have upper respiratory manifestations such as nasal obstruction, nasal discharge and sore throat, and others have gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea [6] . So far, no mortality has been reported in children [7] . The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the contact, travel history and related laboratory tests [6] . Symptomatic and supportive measures, including oxygen, are the main treatment for these patients. Intravenous therapy, correction of water, electrolyte, acid-base imbalances are extremely important as well [6] . Only three newborns have been reported with COVID-19 [1, 6] . These neonates were 36 h, 5 and 17 days old. Their mothers had COVID-19. The disease is rare in neonates, so its suspicioncan help for a quick diagnose."
972,420760,"It was with scenarios like EVD and Zika in mind that the International Health Regulations (IHR) were updated and brought into force in 2007. Their stated purpose and scope was 'to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade'. Although the IHR are aimed at several areas of public health security they can be broadly summarized into two main areas; Urgent actions to be taken with respect to acutely arising risks to public health and Strengthening of national systems and infrastructure (core capacities) While Ireland has no direct flights from the affected countries in West Africa, a significant number of travelers who leave that area arrive in Ireland as their final destination. At least 11,000 people travelled from the region to the UK alone between September and December 2014, for example, and it can be expected that a reasonable number travelled onwards to Ireland. In addition, Ireland also had to contend with significant numbers of returning humanitarian aid workers from the region; between December 2014 and November 2015, 83 of these workers returned to Ireland from their posts in West Africa."
973,519907,"The anti-viral activity of the OAS/RNase L system has been studied in several virus infections in vitro and in vivo [3, 4] . Protective mechanisms of the OAS/RNase L pathway are generally more evident for RNA relative to DNA virus infections. However, the contribution of RNase L to disease severity and viral control varies significantly depending on the virus and even virus strain studied, presumably reflecting the diverse mediators and targets of these anti-viral mediators. For example, encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) replication was only modestly increased in RNase L deficient (RL 2/2 ) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, consistent with enhanced susceptibility to infection in vivo. Although RNase L prolonged survival, mortality rates of infected RL 2/2 and control mice were similar. Furthermore, IFN-b treatment increased the survival time of infected wild-type (wt) and to a lesser extent RL 2/2 mice, indicating that alternate IFN-dependent anti-viral mechanisms act in the absence of RNase L [8] . In contrast, the requirement for RNase L activity to protect from another picornavirus, Coxsackievirus B4, was evident by significantly increased mortality rates of infected RL 2/2 compared to wt mice. However, increased mortality was not the result of uncontrolled virus replication, as virus titers were only slightly elevated within pancreatic islet cells in vivo. By contrast, pancreatic islet cells derived from RL 2/2 mice, treated with IFN-a and infected in vitro exhibited increased virus replication and loss of cellular integrity, compared to IFN-a treated RNase L sufficient cells [9] . These results revealed distinct differences in direct antiviral functions of RNase L in vitro and in vivo. Cell type specific effects of anti-viral RNase L activity are also clearly evident from studies with West Nile virus (WNV). While mouse embryonic fibroblasts display RNase L dependent anti-viral activity [10] , IFN-b treatment revealed no affect of RNase L in reducing WNV replication in either cortical or peripheral motor neurons [11] . Nevertheless, a modest effect was observed in bone marrow derived macrophages, consistent with increased viral burden in CD11b + splenocytes derived from RL 2/2 compared to wt mice [11] . Furthermore, increased mortality of RL 2/2 mice in response to peripheral WNV infection correlated with increased replication in lymphoid tissue, but not enhanced viral dissemination into the CNS. A minor role for RNase L in control of WNV in the CNS was supported by similar viral titers in brains as well as kinetics and rates of mortality following intracranial infection of RL 2/2 and wt mice. Although viral replication was only transiently increased in spinal cords of intracranially infected RL 2/2 mice, the most prominent effect was increased spread to the spleen and liver [11] . The more critical role of RNase L in limiting WNV spread in peripheral tissues rather than the CNS highlights the complexities of OAS/RNase L mediated anti-viral mechanisms in vivo."
974,555790,"The response to an influenza pandemic-like the one we are currently experiencing-might generate remarkable stress and emotional turmoil in healthcare providers who work during the outbreak (Maunder et al., 2008; Barello et al., 2020; Lancet, 2020) . This issue has been shown by many studies on healthcare professionals' experience when facing the COVID-19 pandemic to be one that needs to be urgently addressed (Adams and Walls, 2020; Selman et al., 2020; Williamson et al., 2020) . In these circumstances, health professionals become increasingly crucial points of reference for citizens regarding information on how to cope with the health crisis. This might make them feel fully responsible for managing the situation and often impede their ability to recognize their own human feelings, worries, and concerns (Khalid et al., 2016) ."
975,3106648,"The twentieth century was marked by extraordinary advances in our understanding of microbes and infectious disease, but pandemics remain, food and waterborne illnesses are frequent, multidrug-resistant microbes are on the rise, and the needed drugs and vaccines have not been developed. The scientific approaches of the past-including the intense focus on individual genes and proteins typical of molecular biology-have not been sufficient to address these challenges. The first decade of the twenty-first century has seen remarkable innovations in technology and computational methods. These new tools provide nearly comprehensive views of complex biological systems and can provide a correspondingly deeper understanding of pathogen-host interactions. To take full advantage of these innovations, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently initiated the Systems Biology Program for Infectious Disease Research. As participants of the Systems Biology Program, we think that the time is at hand to redefine the pathogen-host research paradigm."
976,1851872,"The recrudescence events were not associated with the common routes of EVD transmission, such as close contact during burials or care-giving, but rather with other routes or reasons, including sexual transmission, possible immunocompromise, and migration. While use of a 42-day waiting period posed practical difficulties from 2014 to 2016, the present exercise was not intended to criticize that fixed, transparent criterion. Even with the use of a more objective approach, including serial interval distribution (e.g., as applied for Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea (Nishiura et al., 2016) ), this may not have sufficiently captured the involvement of sexual transmission and other reasons for recrudescence."
977,782564,"In the current scenario of novel coronavirus outbreak, governments across the world are struggling to find ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Several countries including Singapore, Australia, UK, Japan, and USA are barring visitors from China, and their citizens in China are required to be quarantined for 14 days prior to entering their native countries. However, the situation is getting out of control and the risk of worldwide pandemic is increasing, as hundreds of people are entering other countries from China without being quarantined. It may increase the difficulties for the whole world rather than mitigating the spread of coronavirus. The governments of these countries (such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Nigeria, and Kenya) must take serious actions in order to educate the public on how best to protect themselves and ensure that everyone moved from China is placed in quarantine [4e6]. There is a real risk of the pandemic spreading out of control in underdeveloped countries as they do not have the facilities to combat the virus as China is doing currently."
978,1635681,"WHO has developed recommendations to provide guidance until transmission characteristics can be determined. The recommendations are based on limited information, including virologic data from seasonal epidemics and volunteer studies rather than pandemics, in which shedding and transmission may be more intense and prolonged because of lack of population immunity. These data indicate that influenza viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract (and presumably also infectiousness) is correlated with fever and the severity of respiratory symptoms in both adults and children. The importance of transmission from infected persons during the incubation period or from persons with asymptomatic infection is uncertain but appears to be substantially less than from symptomatic persons. The principal difficulties in using nonpharmaceutical interventions to reduce influenza transmission among humans include the peak infectivity early in illness and the short incubation period, which both result in a short serial interval between related cases. Recent reports suggest that the 1918 virus may have been less transmissible than previously thought (R 0 1.8-3), although whether public health interventions in 1918 might have affected these estimates is uncertain. If a novel human influenza subtype behaves in a manner similar to the pandemic virus of 1918-1919, available information supports the use of nonpharmaceutical interventions to delay or contain transmission during WHO phases 4 and 5 (limited human-to-human transmission) and use of different interventions to reduce the impact in phase 6 (pandemic phase) (2, 3) ."
979,1704811,"Very little is currently known about the effects of Covid-19 on the human placenta and neonate. The mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus often used as a study model, has been shown to infect the placenta and affect the fetus. 3 Human SARS has been vertically transmitted and in some cases showed fetal thrombotic vasculopathy (fetal vascular malperfusion). 4 In humans, early evidence did not demonstrate vertical transmission of Covid-19 in small cohorts of patients. 5, 6 However, demonstration of IgM antibodies to Covid-19 in a single neonate, who also had elevated cytokines suggests that vertical transmission is possible, even if uncommon. 7 Covid-19 infection has been associated with hypercoagulability, 8 with development of ischemic changes including gangrene of fingers and toes, with evidence of d-dimer elevation, and, in some patients, with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in one series. 9 Whether the fetal vascular malperfusion in some of the cases described in this study is related to hypercoagulability associated with Covid-19 and whether villitis of unknown etiology is related to an antiviral immune response need further study. This is a brief report of initial findings seen in placentas of Covid-19 positive mothers. While one of our cases had fetal vascular malperfusion findings potentially related to a furcate cord insertion, in 8 cases there was no gross umbilical cord abnormality known to be associated with fetal vascular malperfusion. This suggests that maternal Covid-19 infection might be associated with propensity for thrombosis in the fetal circulation. This, in turn, may have significant clinical implications for the mother and infant. On the other hand, as the lesions were low grade, more than half did not have thrombotic lesions and the infants tested negative; hence, these findings may be unrelated. Further studies with additional cases are necessary to determine the reproducibility and significance of these initial findings."
980,921611,"In contrast, production of type I IFNs seems to be inhibited or delayed by SARS-CoV in vitro [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [20] [21] [22] . Moreover, no IFN-a or IFN-b has been detected in the sera of SARS patients or in lungs of SARS-CoV-infected mice [23] [24] [25] . Recent in vitro studies demonstrated that type I IFN inhibition or delay may be orchestrated by SARS-CoV proteins ORF 3B, ORF 6, and N [26] . The inhibition of IFN production would benefit SARS-CoV replication, since pretreatment of cells with IFN before SARS-CoV infection efficiently prevents replication in these cells [21, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Furthermore, prophylactic treatment of macaques with pegylated IFN-a reduces SARS-CoV replication in the lungs [31] ."
981,2661035,"PEDV is an enveloped RNA virus belonging to Group 1a, genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, within the order Nidovirales. The viral genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 28 kb in size, containing six genes: the replicase (Rep), spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) genes, arranged in the order 5'-Rep-S-ORF3-E-M-N-3' [13] [14] [15] . As a coronavirus, PEDV comprises three corresponding major viral structural proteins: the S (180-220 kDa), M (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) , and N (55-58 kDa) proteins [16, 17] . The S protein plays a pivotal role in determining viral-cellular fusion activity and in inducing an immune response in the natural host [18] [19] [20] . The M protein plays an important role in the virus-assembly process, and induces antibodies that neutralize virus in the presence of complement [21] [22] [23] . The N protein of coronaviruses forms a helical ribonucleoprotein with the virus genomic RNA and is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells, thus making it a major viral target [24, 25] . Unlike the structural proteins, little is known about the functions of the accessory proteins. The recently-identified ORF3 gene has been demonstrated to be a potentially important determinant of virulence in this virus [26, 27] ."
982,1451689,"Aminopeptidases are widely distributed enzymes catalyzing the cleavage of amino acids from the amino terminus of protein or peptide substrates, and may localize as subcellular organelles in cytoplasm or as membrane components. Some are monomeric and others are assemblies of relatively high mass (50 kDa) subunits. Many, but not all, of these peptidases are zinc metalloenzymes (M1 family) and are inhibited by the transitionstate analog bestatin. (3, 4) Among this family, APN (EC 3.4.11.2, also known as CD13, microsomal aminopeptidase, aminopeptidase M, alanine aminopeptidase, particle-bound aminopeptidase, p146, p161 or gp150) has been extensively investigated. The full length APN consists of 967 amino acids with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane part, and a large cellular ectodomain containing the active site. (4, 5) Aminopeptidase N is an ubiquitous enzyme present in several human organs, tissues and cell types. It is described as a multifunctional (''moonlighting'') protein with enzymatic as well as other functions, including antigen presentation and a receptor for some human viruses (e.g. coronaviruses).

Disruption of the intestinal mucosa resulting from C. parvum infection thus may substantially increase the risk of death or serious complications in the presence of concurrent viral, and especially bacterial infections. Since cryptosporidiosis is not easily curable, results of this test show that optimal care of sick calves promote protection and quick regeneration of the intestinal mucosa."

Also, we elucidate the influence of potential therapeutics -Azythromycin and HCQ, together with their active metabolites, on the binding of S1 with ACE2. To begin with, we confirmed with Indian SARS-CoV-2 sequences that a stronger interaction with ACE2 exists compared to the SARS-CoV with ensuing implications for higher infection rates and transmission as has been reported recently (Chen Y, et al., 2020) . A preliminary analysis of the two S1 sequences from India, that has witnessed introductions of the virus into the population from geographically distinct sources, reveals two substitutions and a single deletion. Interestingly, one of these substitutions is at position aa 407 within the RBD where a positively charged residue (Arg) is substituted by a hydrophobic residue (Ile). Other than obvious implications for virus-ACE2 binding, we investigated whether this substitution would also affect soluble ACE2 and S1"

Some astrocytes were bi-or multinucleate. Many astrocytes had single intranuclear or multiple intracytoplasmic CDV inclusion bodies. Single myelinated axons had sharply demarcated segments of the axolemma devoid of myelin adjacent to normally myelinated internodes (Fig. 2) , Many individual demyelinated axons were found in areas without cell infiltration and often abutted normal myelinated axons.

989,2034674,"Emerging coronaviruses cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals, posing a significant threat to human health or resulting in enormous economic losses to the global livestock and trade industries. Until now, at least six pathogenic coronaviruses have been reported in swine, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome Coronavirus (SADS-CoV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) and Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). PDCoV is among newly emerged enteropathogenic coronaviruses known to cause severe diarrhea in suckling piglets. To date, no effective vaccines are available to control PDCoV outbreaks. In this study, we successfully constructed the full-length cDNA clone of PDCoV strain CHN-HG-2017 to rescue the infectious PDCoV in vitro, the first reverse genetic system for deltacoronaviruses until now. This technology platform is currently needed for the rational design of attenuated viruses. In addition, this infectious clone serves as a useful molecular tool for systematically investigating the role of viral genes in deltacoronavirus replication, pathogenesis, and virulence. The full-length cDNA clone of PDCoV was assembled from a panel of six adjoining fragments using in vitro ligation; an approach successfully utilized for developing the infectious clones of TGEV, MHV, IBV, NL63, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and PEDV [27, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . The full-length sequence of rPDCoV was identical to the parental PDCoV strain, except for three silent mutations introduced to remove BsmBI restriction sites. The parental PDCoV and rPDCoV demonstrated similar biological characteristics. Both caused indistinguishable CPE in LLC-PK1 cells ( Figure 1B) , exhibited comparable levels of protein expression ( Figure 2D ), generated nearly alike plaque size in LLC-PK1 cells ( Figure 3A) , and replicated with similar growth kinetics in LLC-PK1 and IPI-2I cells ( Figure 3B and C) ."
990,2366898,"In order to evaluate risk factors likely to be altered by exposure to the shelter environment we chose to analyse a subset of data from cats that had spent minimal time in the shelter. Our intention was to exclude data from cases that had seroconverted as a result of exposure to the shelter environment. The interval between primary FCoV infection and seroconversion is between 7 and 18 days (Stoddart et al., 1988) . The time for an anamnestic antibody response to develop in a cat that has previously been infected is likely to be less but remains unknown. As a result, we chose to analyse data from cats that had spent 5 days or less in the shelter. This decision was supported by the appearance of time in shelter prior to sampling in the logit (Fig. 1) . The risk of seropositivity remained constant in cats that had spent up to 6 days in the shelter at the time of sampling."
991,3104636,"Introduction: The ability to predict epitopes plays an enormous role in vaccine development in terms of our ability to zero in on where to do a more thorough in-vivo analysis of the protein in question. Though for the past decade there have been numerous advancements and improvements in epitope prediction, on average the best benchmark prediction accuracies are still only around 60%. New machine learning algorithms have arisen within the domain of deep learning, text mining, and convolutional networks. This paper presents a novel analytically trained and string kernel using deep neural network, which is tailored for continuous epitope prediction, called: Deep Ridge Regressed Epitope Predictor (DRREP). Results: DRREP was tested on long protein sequences from the following datasets: SARS, Pellequer, HIV, AntiJen, and SEQ194. DRREP was compared to numerous state of the art epitope predictors, including the most recently published predictors called LBtope and DMNLBE. Using area under ROC curve (AUC), DRREP achieved a performance improvement over the best performing predictors on SARS (13.7%), HIV (8.9%), Pellequer (1.5%), and SEQ194 (3.1%), with its performance being matched only on the AntiJen dataset, by the LBtope predictor, where both DRREP and LBtope achieved an AUC of 0.702. Conclusion: DRREP is an analytically trained deep neural network, thus capable of learning in a single step through regression. By combining the features of deep learning, string kernels, and convolutional networks, the system is able to perform residue-by-residue prediction of continues epitopes with higher accuracy than the current state of the art predictors."

Authorities should implement strategies to reduce transmission within schools before or instead of closures, 3 including smaller class sizes, physical distancing, and hygiene and sanitation promotion.

993,1122700,"Along with the advancement in medical diagnosis, nucleic acid detection-based approaches have become a rapid and reliable technology for viral detection. Among nucleic acid tests, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method is considered as the 'gold standard' for the detection of some viruses and is characterized by rapid detection, high sensitivity, and specificity. As such, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) is of great interest today for the detection of SARS-CoV -2 due to its benefits as a specific and simple qualitative assay [1] [2] [3] . Moreover, real-time RT-PCR has adequate sensitivity to help us much for diagnosing early infection.

However, increasingly, clinical and experimental studies have revealed that the host immune response can contribute to cryptococcal pathogenesis, including the recent study of L. M. Neal et al. (mBio 8:e01415-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01415-17) that reports that CD4 ϩ T cells mediate tissue damage in experimental murine cryptococcosis. This finding has fundamental implications for our understanding of the pathogenesis of cryptococcal disease; it helps explain why immunotherapy has been largely unsuccessful in treatment and provides insight into the paradoxical observation that HIV-associated cryptococcosis may have a better prognosis than cryptococcosis in those with no known immune impairment. The demonstration that host-mediated damage can drive cryptococcal disease provides proof of concept that the parabola put forth in the damageresponse framework has the flexibility to depict complex and changing outcomes of host-microbe interaction."
995,1174134,"At the Prince Mahidol Awards Conference on 30 January 2018 in Bangkok, Thailand, policy-and decision-makers, experts, researchers, donors and private sector representatives from across the globe came together to introduce and explore the dynamics of the Global Virome Project. The project is an innovative 10-year proposed partnership to develop a global atlas of most of the planet's naturally occurring potentially zoonotic viruses. The project aims to transform the study of emerging diseases by building an unprecedented database of viruses in their ecological contexts. This foundation of information on viral sequences, geographic ranges and host distributions will be used to drive the development of prevention efforts against future threats. This international alliance will connect the next generation of scientists, build capacity at hotspots of viral emergence and promote equitable access to data and strategies to prevent epidemics."
996,2450602,"The first major Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak outside of the Arabian Peninsula began in South Korea in mid-May 2015. Following the index case, a 68-year-old man, who was diagnosed on May 20, 2015, 186 confirmed cases were reported by July 5, 2015 (Fig 1) . In total 14,702 persons were quarantined at some point between May 20 and July 3, 2015. These were voluntary quarantine recommendations, which advise that persons who have had contact with a confirmed case of MERS since onset of illness should quarantine themselves at home or in a health care facility for 14 days. 1 All contacts have their health status monitored daily 1 but are provided with basic necessities and financial compensation for the loss of income during the period of quarantine. Contacts who develop symptoms during the quarantine period will be isolated to receive early treatment, whereas those reporting no illness after the 14day quarantine will be released from further monitoring. 1 However, these voluntary recommendations were often ignored, leading to public outcries in Korea as well as China and Hong Kong, 2,3 and calls for punitive legislation for travelers who make false health declarations. 2 We conducted a population survey during the outbreak of MERS in Korea to investigate public risk perceptions of MERS and attitudes towards quarantine in controlling MERS among households in the Republic of Korea."
997,404785,"Furthermore, elimination may only be sustained by comprehensively containing case importation from outside the country ( Figure 2G and H). Preventing reintroduction requires isolation of all incoming travellers, except those coming from countries that may be certified as free of local transmission by WHO in the future, to achieve 100% prevention of onward local transmission (Figure 1 ). Even 90% containment of imported cases seems unlikely to protect the country against reintroduction of the virus and re-initiation of the epidemic ( Figure 2G and H). Tanzania therefore did the right thing by isolating all inbound travelers since March 23 rd for two weeks following their arrival). However, for such importation containment measures to effectively exclude new cases from a COVID-free Tanzania in the future, isolation periods may need to be extended to three weeks Kam et al., 2020; Ling et al., 2020; Linton et al., 2020; Rothe et al., 2020; Xing et al., 2020; Zou et al., 2020) . However, it is also notable that all the scenarios in figure two, except for panels G and H, assume 100% effective containment of imported cases. It is therefore clear that local transmission must be eliminated before such rigorous control of inbound travellers can usefully protect the country against reintroduction."
998,884919,"M a n u s c r i p t 3 SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) has rapidly emerged as a worldwide cause of severe respiratory disease in adults. [1] Early reports indicate that the course of disease is generally milder in children, but fatal cases have been described. [2] [3] [4] Even in the setting of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection, children may represent a source of SARS-CoV-2 spread in community or hospital settings, so understanding the spectrum of COVID-19 illness in infants, particularly regarding conditions that result in hospitalization, is crucial to establishment of effective infection control interventions. [5] In the first months of life, infants presenting with fever frequently undergo diagnostic evaluations for invasive bacterial disease, even in the absence of other clinical signs. Such evaluations generally include cultures of blood, urine, and, in some cases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), followed by observation and empiric antibiotic therapy in a hospital setting. [6] A significant percentage of febrile infants have infections with respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, and influenza. [7] These viral infections may occur in the presence or absence of invasive bacterial infections. Over a oneweek period in late March 2020 corresponding to a time of widespread community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City, we encountered two febrile infants presenting with minimal or no respiratory symptoms who were found to have SARS-CoV-2 infection without other etiologies despite thorough evaluations."
999,1212231,"During the in vitro study of ribavirin against SARS-CoV, it proved as an important antiviral therapeutic drug (Cinatl et al. 2003; Kumaki et al. 2017) , and no virologic effects were reported during the application of ribavirin as monotherapy (Falzarano et al. 2013; Mo and Fisher 2016) . Like on SARS-CoV, the ribavirin also has the broad-spectrum antiviral activity on MERS-CoV. The in vitro study revealed that high medications of ribavirin effectively induced 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) that was recorded as 41.45 mg/mL (Kumar et al. 2017) . Few clinical trials of ribavirin are also reported in the literature and found that a high level of an intravenous dose of ribavirin of about 1000 mg determined 24 mg/ mL (IC 50 ) (Falzarano et al. 2013 ). However, a study conducted by single-center RCT on SARS-CoV-infected persons reported that the ribavirin and interferon-1a have no noteworthy differences to discharge and symptom improvement (Zhao et al. 2003) . Based on these significant broad-spectrum findings, the ribavirin could be a great therapeutic option to reduce the newly emerged novel coronavirus, namely COVID-19."
1000,451882,"It has been reported that CoVs are non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses, which primarily cause enzootic infections in birds and mammals and have demonstrated strong lethality in humans [1, 2] . These viruses are known to have four structural proteins, including E, M, N and S protein [3, 4] . The primary determinant of CoVs tropism is the S protein, which binds to the membrane receptor on the host cells, mediating the viral and cellular membrane fusion [5] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a homologue of ACE, is one of the important receptors on the cell membrane of the host cells."
1001,802782,"Although there have been only a limited number of reports about hMPV, a picture of the epidemiology of and infection with this virus is beginning to emerge. hMPV may have a seasonal distribution [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , although full-year testing for the virus has only been done in The Netherlands [15] . Most infections with hMPV have been detected during winter and spring. Infection in all age groups has been documented [2, 4, 7, 9, [12] [13] [14] [15] , although young children and elderly persons may be particularly prone [7, 13, 14] . The clinical features associated with hMPV infection in children are consistent with both upper and lower respiratory-tract infections [4, 7, 13] . Jartti et al. [10] have detected hMPV in children who presented with acute wheezing. We have previously reported [13] the clinical features associated with hMPV in infants and young children. To investigate the epidemiology and to describe further the clinical syndrome associated with this newly emerging respiratory pathogen, we tested respiratory specimens from children that were obtained over a 1-year period. Here we describe the seasonal distribution, phylogenetic analysis, and clinical characteristics of infection with hMPV in Connecticut. RNA specimens were then tested by RT-PCR for the presence of hMPV. Random hexamer primers were used to create a cDNA library for each specimen. RT reactions were performed with MuMLV RT (New England Biolabs), according to the manufacturer's specifications. Each cDNA was subsequently tested by PCR with HotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's specification. The primers used in the initial testing of the respiratory specimens were based on sequence data of a Dutch strain available from GenBank (accession number AF371367) and targeted the hMPV F gene. After the amplification and sequencing of the F gene of the first strain of hMPV that we identified, primers were synthesized that targeted regions of the hMPV F gene that were conserved among Dutch, Australian (GenBank accession number AF442516, which subsequently became available), and Connecticut strains. The forward primer, 5 -GCGCGTTCTGA-GGACAGGTTGG, and reverse primer, 5 -GCGCTCAAGCCG-GATGGTTTTGG, produce an amplicon that corresponds to nt 111-392 of the hMPV F gene (GenBank accession number AF371367). G/C clamps for each primer are underlined. All respiratory specimens were tested using these conserved primer sets. Primers were synthesized at the Yale Oligonucleotide Laboratory, Department of Pathology. Each set of RT and PCR reactions contained appropriate negative controls. PCR amplification cycles were as follows: 95ЊC for 15 min; 35 cycles of 94ЊC for 1 min, 45ЊC-55ЊC for 1 min, and 72ЊC for 1 min; and 72ЊC for 10 min. Sequencing was performed on Applied Biosystems 377 DNA automated sequencers at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Lab, Yale University School of Medicine."

This Hospital provides medical care mainly to low-income families residing in the Central Department, which has a population of around 2 million (w25% of Paraguayan population), including approximately 210,000 children under 5 years of age, and a density of 800 inhabitants/km 2 ."
1003,1628410,"The novel coronavirus often causes pulmonary infection, and early and accurate identification of chest imaging characteristics is conducive to early diagnosis, timely isolation, and treatment [5, 6] . Therefore, patients with fever or cough [7, 8] must undergo imaging examinations for further clinical diagnosis of their condition. This makes it easy for the medical staff in the radiology departments to come into contact with patients with COVID-19 and places them in an environment with a high risk of infection [9] . Meanwhile, requirements for efficient and orderly clinical task completion and high-intensity work stress [10] may further increase the psychological load of the staff. If their psychological state cannot be promptly addressed, it is easy for the staff to have negative emotions, which impair their enthusiasm, initiative, and work efficiency and seriously harm their physical and mental health [11, 12] . However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, there were no reports about the resilience level of the medical staff in the radiology department."
1004,2744056,"A typical virus entering the CNS through the blood circulation is the JE virus, which multiplies in the vascular cells of the skin area affected by the mosquito bite. It is subsequently released into the blood to reproduce in mononuclear macrophages throughout the body. The secondary release into the blood may increase the permeability of the blood-brain barrier through the produced cytokines, thereby promoting the virus to enter the brain and causing viral encephalitis (Unni et al., 2011) . Although there is rare evidence that CoV, especially SARS-CoV-2, invade the nervous system via the blood circulation pathway (Koyuncu et al., 2013; Desforges et al., 2019) , subsequent studies are expected."
1005,696535,"An estimated 3 million of the world's 8·8 million cases of pulmonary tuberculosis are not diagnosed and thus are still untreated, continuing to spread the disease in the community. In 2012, of an estimated 450 000 cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis worldwide, 80% were undiagnosed. 108 Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis present with respiratory symptoms and receive repeated courses of antibiotics before being screened for tuberculosis. The continued use of century-old sputum microscopy and the time required for traditional culturebased diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, coupled with the large global health burden and associated mortality of tuberculosis, led to focused global eff orts on new rapid and more sensitive tuberculosis diagnostics (table 5). The past 5 years have seen an unprecedented activity in development of a range of new diagnostic tests based on culture, molecular, and non-molecular methods by scores of small-to-medium sized enterprises. A major concern is that not all marketed tests have been assessed rigorously for diagnostic accuracy, robustness under operational conditions in the fi eld, cost-eff ectiveness, and practical usefulness."

The sensitivities were unchanged when using cutoff amplitudes of 80% of the lower limit of normal for our laboratory ( Table 3 ). The global accuracy of each test (the sum of true positives and true negatives divided by the total population) was 92% for the peroneal motor nerve and 53% for the sural sensory nerve. The 67 patients in the medical, cardiac, and surgical ICUs who underwent muscle ultrasound had a median of one study performed per patient; 33 patients (49%) had the worst echogenicity score in any muscle of 2, and no muscles had scores of 3 or 4. A muscle ultrasound echogenicity score in any muscle of at least 2 out of 4 had a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI 48-98%) and specificity of 57% (95% CI 43-70%) for diagnosing probable CIPNM compared with the reference standard, along with a positive predictive value of 27% and negative predictive value of 94% (Additional file 3: Figure S3 ). The global accuracy of the test was 61%. In all of the patients with probable CIPNM and abnormal echogenicity, the sural and peroneal single NCS were both abnormal. Increased echogenicity was associated with a reduced likelihood of discharge to home (9% vs 50%, p = 0.0001) and fewer ICU-free days (3 (IQR 0-15) vs 16 (9.3-19. 3), p = 0.0002) along with increased ICU mortality (42% vs 12%, p = 0.004). We then determined if ultrasound added prognostic information to that obtained from NCS/EMG. For the main outcome of hospital discharge disposition, abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity was associated with a lower chance of discharge to home (odds ratio 0.42 (95% CI 0.2-0.86), p = 0.02) after adjustment for all the other predictors in the multivariable regression model. For the secondary outcomes, there were no significant associations between abnormal muscle ultrasound echogenicity and ICU-free days or ICU mortality. Only 13 patients had repeated studies of muscle thickness, so we could not examine changes in muscle thickness in this cohort."
1008,1630603,"An earlier study found that 88.4% of the participants believed that they knew the proper steps for wearing a face mask, but only 52.0% answered the procedural questions correctly [6] . The current study further revealed that only 2.3% of the participants correctly performed all eight steps for wearing a face mask. Belief, knowledge and behaviour are different concepts, and their relationships are only weak to moderate [6] . Holding belief and knowledge on a health behaviour does not imply that one performs that health behaviour. The large difference in the reported percentages between these studies suggests that simply spending effort to promote belief and increase knowledge of a health behaviour for a population is unlikely to result in a behavioural change. Efforts should focus on directly teaching the required skill and modifying factors that have considerable effect on behavioural change."

On January 2020, World health organization emergency committee declared a global health emergency based on the high rate of spreading of the infection with high fatality rate (Chhikara et al., 2020; Kumar & Rathi, 2020) . As of now on 4th April 2020, Europe and USA are new epicentres of Pandemic. Even in the past, different coronaviruses have caused multiple human diseases that resulted in global epidemics such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 . While the coronaviruses have a significant impact on human health, the general public has an inferior awareness of coronavirus pathogenesis and infection. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020 as the worldwide human population is facing high risk from contracting the nCoV infection. Many countries, including India, has announced lockdown in the country and to maintain social distancing to avoid further spread as no drug or vaccine is available against SARS-CoV-2. Coronavirus has been classified into four subfamilies based on their shape and host. These subfamilies are alpha-coronavirus, beta-coronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta coronavirus (Paules et al., 2020) . Alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus are considered to have been originated from bats, while the gamma and delta coronaviruses are considered to be derived from birds and pigs (Banerjee et al., 2019) . Coronaviruses contain a positive sense, single-strand RNA genome coding for viral polymerase, RNA synthesis materials, and large nonstructural polypeptide. Coronavirus genome contains transcriptional modification, including 5'methylated cap and a 3'polyadenylated tail. Coronaviruses have very high rates of error in RNA replication due to constant errors by RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Banerjee et al., 2019; Lau et al., 2018) ."

We generated model variants for each hypothesis ( Fig 1a ) and fitted to three data sources from the early epidemic in Wuhan for each hypothesis ( Fig, 1b, 1c ). We included school closures, for which we decreased the school contacts of children.

1014,1624077,"Among various psychosocial approaches, the Health Belief Model is one of the most widely used and provides the necessary conceptual framework for this study. This model postulates that the practice of preventive behaviors is a function of the degree to which individuals perceive a personal health threat and the perception that particular preventive behaviors will be effective in reducing the threat [10] . In applying this model to understand the practice of SARS preventive behaviors, perceived health threat refers to individuals' perception of their vulnerability to contracting SARS (perceived susceptibility) and that this disease has serious consequences (perceived severity). Individuals' be-lief that the practice of the suggested SARS preventive behaviors will prevent SARS depends on (1) whether they think these preventive behaviors will be effective (perceived benefits), (2) whether the cost of undertaking these behaviors (perceived barriers) exceeds the benefits, and (3) whether there are any cues (cues to action) to trigger these behaviors. Cues to action can be internal, such as the perception of a body state, or external, such as the influence of mass media and social pressure."

The mainstay of clinical treatment consists of symptomatic management and oxygen therapy, with mechanical ventilation for patients with respiratory failure. Although several antiviral drugs, including the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, are being actively tested, none has been specifically approved for COVID-19.

1020,993082,"A pseudovirus is a recombinant viral particle with its core/backbone and envelope proteins derived from different viruses 1 ; moreover, the genes inside the pseudovirus are usually altered or modified so that they are unable to produce the surface protein on their own. As such, an additional plasmid or stable cell line expressing the surface proteins is needed to make the pseudovirus. 2 Pseudoviruses are capable of infecting susceptible cells, but they only replicate for 1 round in the infected host cells. 3 Compared with wild-type (WT) viruses, pseudoviruses can be safely handled in biosafety level (BSL)-2 laboratories 4 and are usually easier to manipulate experimentally. 5 Nevertheless, the conformational structure of pseudoviral surface proteins bears high similarity to that of the native viral proteins, and these surface proteins can effectively mediate viral entry into host cells. Therefore, pseudoviruses are widely used for the study of cellular tropism, 6 receptor recognition, 7 and virus inhibition, 8 as well as for developing and evaluating antibodies 9 and vaccines. 10 In addition, data from in vitro pseudovirus-based antiviral assays and in vivo biodistribution analyses have been found to correlate very well with the results generated by using live WT viruses. 11, 12 As pseudoviruses have usually been engineered to carry reporter genes, it is much easier to perform quantitative analyses on these viruses than on WT viruses, 13 and the number of pseudovirus-infected cells has been shown to be directly proportional to reporter gene expression. The reporter genes usually encode either an enzyme or a fluorescent protein, with each option having its particular strengths and weaknesses. Specifically, chemiluminescence assays usually have lower background and are more sensitive, but the data acquisition and analyses for these assays are time-consuming and more expensive."

She self-isolated herself at home after diagnosis and observed her prognosis. She had mild symptoms and received conservative treatment without medication. The symptoms improved and she only had a mild cough with no fever and sputum on February 29. She wanted to delay delivery until she recovered from the infection. However, an emergency C-sec was decided on March 6 (37 +6 weeks) due to obstructed labor with incomplete rotation of the fetal head. The patient was transferred to our center, which is a designated hospital for pregnant patients infected with SARS-Cov-2. Her blood type was 'O-Rh (+)' and pre-natal workup did not show any specific findings. On arrival, she was immediately transferred to the radiology center for chest radiographs and computer tomography (CT) scans. We then transferred her to a pre-treatment room in the delivery center equipped with negative-pressure ventilation, exclusive elevators, and pre-operative laboratory test kits, including electrocardiograph (ECG), X-ray machine, blood tests, and urine test. Hemoglobin was 10.9 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was slightly elevated (42 mm/h), C-reactive protein was normal (0.15 mg/dl), and other pre-operative laboratory test and ECG results seemed normal. The chest radiographs revealed left lower/middle lobe consolidation and increased vascular marking (Fig. 1A) . We also observed multifocal peribronchial ground glass appearance and consolidation in the left lower lobe from chest CT scans (Fig. 1B) . The SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) result of sputum and nasopharyngeal swab was obtained pre-operatively. Baseline fetal heart rate was 129 beats/min. The C-sec was performed in an operating room at the delivery center, which is located on a different floor from the main operating room ( Figs. 2A and 2B) . Hence, the traffic line of the patient did not overlap with that of the other surgical patients. In this case, spinal anesthesia was selected as the anesthetic method, because even if we started with spinal anesthesia, there could still be chances of switching to general anesthesia in case of inadequate anesthesia or sudden changes in the patient's clinical condition. We were already equipped with a ventilator protected by three mechanical high-efficiency particulate air filters, video laryngoscope, fiber-optic laryngoscope blades and handles, endotracheal tubes (6.5 mm, 7.0 mm, and stylet), medication drugs such as propofol, lidocaine, rocuronium, sugammadex, atropine, and closed suction catheter before the patient entered the operating room."
1022,2664964,"Accumulating evidence suggests that many pathogens, especially viruses, require lipid rafts at multiple stages of their life cycles. Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), Semliki Forest virus and some human enteroviruses require lipid rafts during the binding and internalization of virus particles into host cells [2e4] . Interestingly, the receptors or co-receptors for certain viruses have been reported to be associated with lipid rafts on cell membranes, such as CD4 for HIV-1 [5] , heat shock proteins 70 and 90 for dengue virus [6] and integrin avb3 for human cytomegalovirus [7] . Raft microenvironments also provide a platform for virus assembly as well as viral release. In the case of influenza virus, for example, both the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain of one of the viral proteins, hemagglutinin, facilitate the binding of another viral protein, matrix 1, to detergent-resistant lipid rafts [8] . Similarly, lipid rafts were also shown to be necessary for the assembly of HIV-1 [9] and Sendai virus [10] . Several enveloped viruses contain lipid rafts on their membranes, and cholesterol depletion by MbCD was shown to inactivate and permeabilize the virions, suggesting the importance of virus-associated cholesterol for infectivity [11, 12] . Furthermore, Nef protein of HIV-1 is reported to be able to increase the infectivity of HIV-1 via lipid rafts [13] . Therefore, lipid rafts could play important roles not only in virus replication but also in viral pathogenesis."
1023,1882622,"Nsp3 is the largest among the non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV. It is believed to comprise at least six domains ( Fig. 1A) : (1) an N-terminal acidic domain which is rich in glutamate; (2) the 'X domain' which binds poly(ADP-ribose) and has a fold similar to the macrodomain of histone 2A [5, 6] ; (3) the SARS-unique domain (SUD) which has only been found in SARS-CoV so far [4, 7] ; (4) a papain-like protease (PL2 pro ), which also exhibits deubiquitinating activity and is involved in suppression of the type-I interferon response of the host cell [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] ; (5) an additional, non-canonical papain-like domain identified by bioinformatics (Ferron and Canard, personal communication); and (6) the 'Y domain', which contains an N-terminal transmembrane subdomain [13] . Except for the PL2 pro , the functions of these domains are unclear. Some may play a role as part of the replicase/transcriptase complex of the virus, and others may interact with components of the host cell. A recent study of the interactome of the proteins of the SARS coronavirus indicated some interaction between an N-terminal fragment of Nsp3 with Nsp2 and with Orf3a. However, no results were obtained for the SARS-unique domain (SUD) because for cloning reasons, it was cleaved into two halves [14] . We believe that the SUD might be of particular interest for elucidating the basis for the high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV for humans. All other coronaviruses, including the recently discovered human coronaviruses NL63 [15] and HKU1 [16] , do not have this domain, and since they are much less pathogenic for humans, it is conceivable that there is a correlation between the presence of the SUD and viral pathogenicity. We therefore decided to produce this domain using recombinant DNA technology and in-vitro protein synthesis in order to study its interactions with components of the virus and the host cell. In this communication, we show for the first time that full-length SUD as well as a truncated version bind oligo(G) stretches (''Gstrings'') in nucleic acids."
1024,1725913,"Long-distance RNA-RNA interactions mediate CoV RNA synthesis. CoV discontinuous transcription process implies a premature termination during the synthesis of the minus stranded RNAs and a template switch of the nascent minus RNA to the leader region. This switch requires long distance RNA-RNA interactions, probably assisted by RNA-protein complexes that would bring in close proximity the 5' end TRS-L and the TRS-B located 5' upstream of each gene (Fig. 4) . These complexes, formed previously to template switch, might contribute to the stop of the minus RNA synthesis at TRS-B sequences. 3, 5, 31 After this template switch takes place, a copy of the leader sequence is added to the nascent RNA by a discontinuous synthesis step. 29, 79, 80 The requirement of base pairing between the newly synthesized minus RNA and the TRS-L to facilitate transcription has been described in arteriviruses 27, 30 and CoVs. 3, 27, 31, 81, 82 The TRSs include a conserved CS and 5' and 3' variable flanking sequences. The template switch takes place after copying the CS sequence. A three RNA strand intermediate could be formed before template switching takes place, including the RNA template (TRS-B), the nascent negative stranded RNA (cTRS-B) and the leader region (TRS-L). If the ΔG associated to the formation of TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex is above a minimum threshold, the template switch may take place. 3, 31 CoV transcription resembles a similarity assisted copy-choice RNA recombination mechanism, 26,27 being the TRS-L the acceptor RNA and cTRS-B the donor RNA. This recombination mechanism requires sequence homology between the donor and acceptor RNAs and a hairpin structure present in the acceptor RNA. [83] [84] [85] Recently, it has been reported that a template switch may also take place within CoV sgRNAs in the absence of the standard TRS-L structure, an innovative result that may require RNA. 99 This circularized ribonucleoprotein is required to initiate the synthesis of the negative stranded RNA. 100 In contrast, the binding of the cellular poly(rC) binding protein (PCBP) to the 5' cloverleaf RNA promotes the translation. 101 Similarly, in pestivirus such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), genome circularization is also mediated by three proteins of the NFAR group. This circularization promotes the switch from translation to replication. 102 Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) uses specific higher-order RNA structures located at the termini of viral genome to regulate the translation and viral RNA synthesis. The replication process requires direct 5' to 3' end RNA-RNA interactions mediated by the S region preceding the IRES, the IRES 5' end and the 3' end of the genome. 103 In addition, RNA-protein interactions also play an important role connecting both ends."
1025,1099621,"Docking experiment is performed using the optimized COVID-19 and SARS (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A) RdRps by the aid of AutoDock Vina software implemented in SCIGRESS [45] . Eight different compounds [11, 19, 23, [51] [52] [53] ). Ribavirin is a broad-acting antiviral drug used to treat different viruses in combination with immunomodulators or direct-acting antivirals [54] [55] [56] . Remdisivir is a nucleotide analog used to treat Ebola virus, Marburg virus, MERS and SARS infections [57] . Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone are negative control compounds that proved its inactivity against RdRp in HCV and Zika virus [26] . After docking, the structures are examined by the aid of the Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) web server (Technical University of Dresden) and tabulated for comparison [58] . Fig. 1A shows the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of RNA dependent RNA polymerases from Different HCoV strains including the Alphacoronaviruses (229E and NL63) and the Betacoronaviruses (OC43, HKU1, SARS, MERS, and COVID-19). SARS HCoV secondary structure is shown at the top of the MSA (PDB ID: 6NUR chain: A) while its water accessibility found at the bottom of the MSA. Highly accessible residues are in blue boxes, while buried residues are represented in white at the bottom of the MSA. The black-dashed rectangle marks active site residues (successive aspartates residues D255 and D256). The active site aspartates are protruding from the beta-turn joining the β15 and β16. As implied from the MSA, the active site is highly conserved (highlighted in red). Also, the 5 Å region surrounding the D255 and D256 is highly conserved in all HCoVs, as shown by the blue-dashed rectangles. This region includes Y114, C117, N186, N190, M251, I252, L253, S254, A257, V258, E306, F307, C308, and S309. The active site residues and most of the 5 Å region surrounding it are surface accessible, though can bind to the free nucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) [23, 25] . figure) . The active site is surface accessible as we can see from the surface representation allowing the interaction with the free nucleotides passing through the nucleotide channel of the RdRp. Although some insertions found in COVID-19 RdRp, these insertions are apart from the active site aspartates and have little effect on the model quality (see the Ramachandran plot). Additionally, the homology built model is minimized using the MM3 force field to ensure its reliability before performing the docking study."
1026,915365,"Neither pigs nor chickens were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 by intranasal or oculo-oronasal infection. All swabs, organ samples, and contact animals were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and did not seroconvert. Our findings on the non-permissiveness of chickens to SARS-CoV-2 infection were similar to those of previous reports showing the lack of susceptibility of chickens to SARS-CoV 16 and support other study findings. 17 We showed that this finding extends to embryonated chicken eggs, which are a classic substrate for isolation and propagation of a plethora of zoonotic viruses. These data are also in agreement with findings on the chicken ACE2 receptor, 18 which contains alterations in three of five critical residues (Lys31Glu, Glu35Arg, and Met82Arg). By contrast, similar predictions suggested that pigs and ferrets were likely to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 because of these animals' matching ACE2 receptorbinding sites. 18 However, our study, as well as the report by Shi and colleagues, 17 found no susceptibility of pigs by the intranasal inoculation route. Nevertheless, we showed permissiveness of two out of three porcine cell lines tested. The young age of the pigs might have had an influence as an age dependency has been found in other animals-eg, monkeys. 19 To further exclude an anthropozoonotic spill-over infection into farm animals, further experiments should focus on Bovidae or other animals, which are predicted to be susceptible according to cell culture data. 20 We found that intranasal inoculation of fruit bats resulted in a transient infection in the respiratory tract and virus shedding in fruit bats. SARS-CoV-2 genomes could be detected by RT-qPCR in nasal conchae, trachea, lung, tracheal lymph node, skin, and duodenum tissue. Infectious virus was isolated from nasal conchae and trachea. Oral viral RNA shedding was detectable up to day 12 after infection, but infectious virus could only be isolated at day 2. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation found that most inoculated fruit bats had viral genome in their nasal cavity at day 4. Rhinitis was associated with the presence of viral antigen, mainly in the respiratory epithelium. Despite the absence of viral antigen at later timepoints, rhinitis was still identifiable, indicating previous replication sites. Some infected animals and one contact fruit bat presented with mild inflammation in the lung, which should be addressed in future studies because no viral antigen or bacteria were detectable. Starting from day 8, all inoculated bats developed a weak immune response. The virus was transmitted to one out of the three contact fruit bats. The affected animal was at an early pregnancy. Several studies show an increased virus detection rate in bats during the reproductive phase, probably due to the associated immunosuppression. 21 The other two contact animals were seronegative. In fruit bat 11, the trans mission of viral RNA possibly did not result in sufficient local replication, which could explain the single positive oral swab result and the lack of antibody production. β-coronaviruses were shown to infect a variety of bat species with few clinical signs, even during active virus shedding. 22 Moreover, low antibody titres are typical for bats. 23 Although Egyptian fruit bats express ACE2 in the intestine and respiratory tract, a study found little evidence of virus replication and sero conversion after infection with SARS-like coronaviruses; however, serum samples of some of these bats, collected before the infection, were already reactive with SARS spike or nucleocapsid proteins. 24 Our data suggest that intranasal infection of Rousettus aegyptiacus could reflect reservoir host status and therefore represent a useful model, although this species is certainly not the original reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 because these bats are not present in China, the epicentre of the pandemic. Furthermore, we showed that bat-to-bat transmission is possible. Consequently, although our findings for Rousettus aegyptiacus might not apply to all bat species, as over 1200 of them exist, our results indicate bats are at risk of being infected anthropozoonotically by SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, during the pandemic, all contact with bats (eg, during research programmes or ecological analyses), should be avoided."
1027,1412249,"Odds surveillance was also identified (Wentholt et al., 2012) . Especially in the first stages of an outbreak, or for diseases where animals do not show clear clinical symptoms, we see benefits from targeting herds with high measures of live animal contacts. Although BCV and BRSV were primarily used as general examples of contagious diseases, some of the findings in this study can be worthwhile mentioning in specific relation to BCV and BRSV. Both diseases can spread through other types of contacts, e.g. visitors such as veterinarians; and the relative importance of animal trade and farm visits has not been investigated in relation to these infections in Swedish beef cattle. Previous studies conducted in Norway and Sweden have evaluated the association between herd-level characteristics and BCV and BRSV infections in dairy herds. The identified risk factors were similar for both viruses: large herd size was found to be a risk factor compared with small herd size (Tråvén et al., 1999; Norström et al., 2000) , as was artificial insemination (AI) by farm personnel compared with AI by external technicians, conventional compared with organic management (Bidokhti et al., 2009) , and not providing boots for visitors (Ohlson et al., 2010) . However, in the present study, animal trade seems to be more important for BCV than BRSV. This is an interesting finding that may be explained by the slightly different epidemiology of these two viral diseases. Signs of diarrhoea (the main symptom of BCV) might not be recorded by the farmer as easily as coughing (the main symptom of BRSV), so the risk of selling animals with ongoing BRSV infection might therefore be lower. The fact that BCV is shed via faeces (Clark, 1993) could also contribute, as it is difficult to clean out and more voluminous than nasal discharge, which is the primary means of transmission for BRSV (Van der Poel et al., 1994) ."
1028,3076758,"In order to develop a dose-response model for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the pooled data sets for infection of transgenic mice susceptible to SARS-CoV and infection of mice with murine hepatitis virus strain 1, which may be a clinically relevant model of SARS, were fit to beta-Poisson and exponential models with the maximum likelihood method. The exponential model (k = 4.1 × l0 2 ) could describe the dose-response relationship of the pooled data sets. The beta-Poisson model did not provide a statistically significant improvement in fit. With the exponential model, the infectivity of SARS-CoV was calculated and compared with those of other coronaviruses. The does of SARS-CoV corresponding to 10% and 50% responses (illness) were estimated at 43 and 280 PFU, respectively. Its estimated infectivity was comparable to that of HCoV-229E, known as an agent of human common cold, and also similar to those of some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group. Moreover, the exponential model was applied to the analysis of the epidemiological data of SARS outbreak that occurred at an apartment complex in Hong Kong in 2003. The estimated dose of SARS-CoV for apartment residents during the outbreak, which was back-calculated from the reported number of cases, ranged from 16 to 160 PFU/person, depending on the floor. The exponential model developed here is the sole dose-response model for SARS-CoV at the present and would enable us to understand the possibility for reemergence of SARS."
1029,801540,"In March 2014, Guinea identified 49 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and reported them to international health agencies [1] . Nearly twelve months later, the epidemic, having exploded into neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia, has reached over 22,000 cases and nearly 9,000 deaths. The toll on human life, impact on health infrastructure, diversion of funding from routine-but critical-priorities, and concentrated mortality among health care workers places the epidemic among the worst disease outbreaks in recent history. After a delayed response [2] , the World Health Organization (WHO) laid out a programmatic roadmap to mobilize financial support and human resources [3] . In addition, for the first time in its history, the United Nations (UN) Security Council has authorized an emergency health mission, the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, with assets typically committed to peacekeeping. The massive response that followed, involving multiple foreign governments, multinational partners, and regional ministries of health, has brought unprecedented resources to the West African region. Towards the end of 2014, the epidemic showed signs of coming under control, particularly in Guinea and Liberia. Compared to worst-case scenario estimates from earlier in the epidemic, this global response has likely saved many thousands of lives [4] ."

1031,1213926,"PRRSV is a member of the Arteriviridae family within the order Nidovirales, which also includes the Coronaviridae and Roniviridae families. The nidovirus order constitutes a group of singlestranded positive-sense RNA viruses which share a hallmark replication/transcription strategy, similar genomic organization, and a defining set of genetic elements, but differ in host species and range, disease phenotype, virion morphology, cellular tropism, genomic size and encoded content . The Arteriviridae family is composed of five viruses which share similar genetic and biological characteristics such as genomic organization and content, morphology and a cellular tropism for the macrophage lineage . Viral species include PRRSV, simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), lactate-dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), newly recognized wobbly possum disease virus (WPDV) in free-ranging Australian brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and equine arteritis virus (EAV; arterivirus prototype species) Dunowska et al., 2012; Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . The similar genomic organization, characteristic genetic elements and common functionality of orthologous proteins however have led to the acceptance of many putative functions for PRRSV proteins, often derived from studies of the arterivirus prototype species EAV and the more distantly related nidoviruses. Each arterivirus infects only one animal species, in contrast to other nidoviruses such as some coronaviruses, which have been shown to transmit between species (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 2013) ."
1032,538047,"The rapid development of numerous SARS-CoV-2 assays has demonstrated the tremendous momentum the diagnostics industry and clinical laboratories have achieved to improve access to diagnostic testing. The availability of five-minute testing for SARS-CoV-2 was touted as 'gamechanging'. However, the low sensitivity observed has important implications for COVID-19 control as missed diagnoses may increase risk of viral transmission. Sensitivity may vary depending on the range of Ct values tested, and has been reported to be higher in a separate study with 94% positive percent agreement compared to the modified CDC assay. 5 Furthermore, concerns about risk of aerosolization during sample processing suggest this test may be only safely performed within a biosafety cabinet or with full personal protective equipment. 6 As shown in this comparative diagnostic accuracy study, the performance of the 5-minute pointof-care test has significant limitations for the diagnosis of COVID-19. We suggest that repeat testing be performed in a clinical laboratory with EUA for patients with a moderate to high pretest probability who test negative with this device."
1033,2811129,"Selected donors should be otherwise medically suitable, with mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and without severe organ dysfunction attributed to SARS-CoV-2. Based on the potential risk of transmission, use of organs that are considered to have the highest risk of a larger burden of viable virus should be avoided. These would include lung transplants and transplants in which part of the bowel is used (e.g. small bowel, pancreas, or kidney-pancreas). We propose considering liver and heart transplants for carefully selected patients, guided by the principle of optimizing the risk to benefit ratio. Table 3 summarizes the donor and recipient features that should be considered in this assessment, as well as resource availability, procurement, and post-transplant management that must also be addressed. A prospective registry should gather data about these recipients. If there is favorable experience with more urgent heart and liver transplantation, the use of organs from SARS-CoV-2 positive donors for less urgent heart and liver transplants could be considered. We feel that kidney transplantation could be cautiously considered for recipients with extreme sensitization and/or limited dialysis access, for whom transplantation might realistically represent a more immediately life-saving option."
1034,838203,"Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are key components in the protective immune responses to viral infections, because they can bind to viral particles and block them from entering the host cells [7] [8] [9] . Many CoVs are potent inducers of NAbs, which exhibit protective activities in vivo [10, 11] . The NAb against SARS-CoV has been analyzed recently, by use of a conventional neutralizing assay, in a small number of serum samples from patients with SARS [12] . Such a conventional assay requires culturing of wild-type virus, which is cumbersome and unsafe. In the present article, we describe an improved assay for analyzing NAbs to SARS-CoV based on a newly established SARS-CoV pseudovirus system. This assay measures the expression of luciferase as a result of pseudovirus infection and is, therefore, highly sensitive and reproducible. In addition, the assay is safe and can be performed in a highthroughput fashion. Using our neutralization assay, we analyzed serum samples obtained from 623 patients with SARS in the Beijing area, which was severely affected during the 2003 epidemic, with 125% of the total cases in the world. We found that a great majority (85.9%) of the serum samples from patients with SARS contained high titers of NAbs against SARS-CoV. We report here the characterization of the NAbs and the kinetics of generation of NAbs. Our results have important implications for the development of antibody therapy and vaccine for SARS."

Whereas, there were no cases of ON in the HIV-negative group. The risk factors included lipid-lowering agents, testosterone, and detectable level of anticardiolipin in the HIV-infected patients. Most recently, Bottaro [3] postulated that the risk factors peculiar to HIVinfected individuals that might play a role in the pathogenesis of ON include the introduction of protease inhibitors and resulting hyperlipidemia, the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in serum leading to a hypercoagulable state, immune recovery, and vasculitis.

1039,1863719,"IBV is an avian coronavirus with a single-stranded, positive-sense, RNA genome of approximately 27 kb. The 3′ end of the genome encodes four structural proteins, including spike glycoprotein (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and four non-structural accessory proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b. The 5′ end of the genome encodes two polyproteins (1a and 1ab) that contain proteins necessary for RNA replication (Boursnell et al., 1987) . Similar to other coronaviruses, genetic diversity in IBV is created by both recombination events (Kottier et al., 1995) and by mutations, including substitutions, deletions, and insertions (Shi et al., 2000) , that occur during replication of the viral genome. The high mutation rates are attributed to the limit of replication fidelity although it has been shown that coronaviruses possess proofreading enzyme (3′-to-5′ exoribonuclease) which is essential for replication fidelity (Denison et al., 2011) , while recombination events are thought to result from a unique templateswitching copy-choice mechanism during RNA replication (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011) ."
1040,696976,"Overview of the current state A new coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, has emerged as the cause of an unusual cluster of viral pneumonia cases in China. 1, 2 The situation has rapidly evolved into a global health emergency as declared by the World Health Organization. 3 Canada has joined the list of countries with patients identified as confirmed or suspected active 2019-nCoV infection in two provinces. Repatriation of Canadian citizens from China is expected to result in hundreds of patients requiring quarantine while monitoring for symptoms and signs of disease. 4 This single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus has been fully sequenced, and appears to be distinct from but related to other coronaviruses causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). 2, 5 Mechanisms of transmission are believed to include contact, droplet, and possibly airborne under certain circumstances based on historical experiences related to SARS-CoV outbreaks. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for this infection, given variable host and environmental factors, is estimated in the initial outbreak to be between 2.2 and 3.6 (number of cases generated after exposure to one patient), 11 which is similar to SARS-CoV but higher than MERS-CoV. The case fatality rate is estimated to be approximately 2% based on latest reported data, 12 less than SARS-CoV (approximately 10%) 13 and MERS-CoV (approximately 40%) 14 but significantly higher than the 2009 pH1N1 (0.026%). 15 Over 20,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide in 25 countries across multiple continents. 16 At the time of writing, there are over 2,500 cases considered severe, and over 400 reported deaths. 12 These figures are considered by many as gross underestimates of the disease prevalence and are rapidly changing."

However, PVP-I (7.5 or 10%) has been shown to achieve significantly higher removal rates than CHG 4% and plain soap against other bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA and A. baumannii [30, 31, 33, 36] . It should be noted that alcohol rubs have outperformed PVP-I and CHG in removing E. coli in some studies [32, 36, 37] . The findings of our virucidal study are in agreement with the results of a previous study by Steinmann et al. [35] that used MNV as a test organism in a modified finger pad test based on the ASTM E 1838 [34] , with modifications derived from the EN1500 [11]. Steinmann et al. found that a PVP-I formulation with 0.75-0.81% available iodine performed better than three alcohol-based hand rubs, while 4% CHG and 1% triclosan hand washes were ineffective [35] . An earlier fingertip test using feline calcivirus (a surrogate for norovirus) by Lages et al. also showed a significantly greater log 10 reduction factor for 10% PVP-I antiseptic compared with two triclosan-containing soaps and five hand sanitizers after 30 s contact time [38] . A recent review of in vitro and in vivo virucidal activity of ethanol concluded that 80% ethanol is highly effective against enveloped viruses, MNV and adenovirus type 5 are usually inactivated by 70-90% ethanol, while 95% ethanol is required to inactivate most other non-enveloped viruses [39] ."
1043,332064,"In the present study, we aimed at characterizing the pathological changes in the liver of CCHFV-infected IFNAR 2/2 mice in more detail. Furthermore, we employed this model to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin, arbidol, and T-705 (favipiravir) against CCHFV in vivo. These drugs are either in clinical use or in an advanced stage of clinical testing. Ribavirin inhibits CCHFV replication in cell culture [15] and is administered to CCHF patients, though its clinical benefit is not proven and discussed controversially [16] [17] [18] [19] . It shows beneficial effects in the neonatal and STAT1 2/2 mouse models [9, 10] . Ribavirin currently is the only drug available for treatment of CCHF. Arbidol is a broadspectrum antiviral showing activity against a range of RNA viruses in vitro and in vivo, most notably influenza A virus [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . In Russia and China, the drug is in clinical use primarily for prophylaxis and treatment of acute respiratory infections including influenza. Arbidol is assumed to act via hydrophobic interactions with membranes and virus proteins, thus inhibiting viral fusion and entry [25] [26] [27] . T-705 is a potent inhibitor in vitro and in animal models of influenza virus, phleboviruses, hantaviruses, arenaviruses, alphaviruses, picornaviruses, and norovirus [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Following conversion to T-705-ribofuranosyl-59-triphosphate, it presumably acts as a nucleotide analog that selectively inhibits the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or causes lethal mutagenesis upon incorporation into the virus RNA [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . T-705 (favipiravir) is currently in late stage clinical development for the treatment of influenza virus infection."
1044,3145702,"In December 2019, a novel coronavirus pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members."
1045,1620522,"Interesting interplays between recombination and mutation rates have also been recently found in RNA viruses. These two processes are primarily controlled by the viral polymerase since, in RNA viruses, recombination takes place when the viral polymerase switches between different template genomes present in the same cell [123] . The estimated recombination rates of different riboviruses and retroviruses correlate positively with estimated mutation rates [124] . High mutation rates confer viruses the ability to rapidly produce advantageous mutations, but also inflate the genetic load of the population. In turn, frequent recombination allows beneficial mutations to unlink from deleterious genetic backgrounds, as well different beneficial mutations to be combined into the same genome. As such, recombination is expected to enhance adaptation when a large number of alleles coexist in the same population, a scenario that typically takes place at high mutation rates [125] . Experimental evidence supporting the joint effects of recombination and mutation rates in viral adaptability has been recently obtained using poliovirus polymerase mutants that individually alter replication fidelity or recombination rate [126] . In another recent work, a lowfidelity variant of Sindbis virus was found to exhibit increased recombination [127] . This variant showed low fitness and a greater tendency to accumulate defective interfering particles (i.e. mutant viruses with large deletions that depend on and interfere with the wild-type infection cycle). Therefore, it appears that high mutation and recombination rates enhance viral adaptability, but only up to a certain point, beyond which both processes contribute to the accumulation of deleterious alleles in the population."
1046,410022,"Chest CT findings at baseline. The varied findings on chest radiographs remain difficult to interpret because of nonstandard and vague terminology such as ""airspace disease,"" ""pneumonia,"" ""infiltrates,"" ""patchy opacities,"" and ""hazy opacities"" (3, 5) . The more straightforward descriptions of CT findings can clarify findings on chest radiographs. The predominant CT findings of COVID-19 infection are bilateral, peripheral and basal predominant ground-glass opacity, consolidation, or both (6, 7) . Opacities often have an extensive geographic distribution. Multiple discrete areas of ground-glass opacity, consolidation or both occur in a subset of patients-often with round morphology or a reversed halo or atoll sign (see the RSNA journals' compilation of the spectrum of published images: https://pubs.rsna.org/2019-nCoV#images). Pleural effusion, extensive tiny lung nodules, and lymphadenopathy occur in a very small number of cases and suggest bacterial superinfection or another diagnosis."

Treatment with NTZ 600 mg bd for 5 days was associated with reduction in duration of symptoms 95.5 h (84.0-108.0) compared to placebo (116.7 h (95% CI 108.1-122.1) (p = .0084), whereas the 300 mg bd cohort was not significantly different than the control [109.1 h (96.1-129.5, p = .52)] (Haffizulla et al., 2014) . Influenza-infected subjects receiving NTZ 600 mg also showed significant reductions in TCID50 viral titers on study Days 1-3 vs the placebo group (p = .0006). No resistance was observed for influenza viruses collected from NTZ-treated subjects, and no adverse effect on the humoral immune response was observed. Adverse events were similar among the three treatment groups (Haffizulla et al., 2014) ."
1049,1363057,"Since the first diagnosis of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, 1 1,283 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported in Saudi Arabia as of December 31, 2015, including at least 551 related deaths with approximate case fatality of 43%. 2 This represented approximately 80% of the total number of globally reported cases of MERS-CoV. 3 According to the Saudi Ministry of Health, 45% of the reported cases were classified as healthcare-acquired infections among either patients or healthcare workers (HCWs). 2 Although sporadic cases have been reported in Saudi hospitals during the past 3 years, MERS-CoV infections in healthcare settings are frequently seen as small clusters or sometimes large outbreaks. 4 For example, small clusters including a total of 23 cases have been detected in 3 healthcare facilities in the Eastern region between April and May 2013. 5 Additionally, a large hospital outbreak with 255 cases has been reported from multiple hospitals in Jeddah in the first half of 2014 with the peak between March and April 2014. 6 The recent Korean outbreak that involved 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, has further raised the global concern of the possibility of large hospital outbreaks even with only one or a few community cases. 7, 8 In June 2013, the first case of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed at our hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh (KAMC-R). Since then, a total of 32 patients and 14 HCWs have had confirmed MERS-CoV infections through early March 2015. 9 The cases were distributed as sporadic cases and small clusters. In late June 2015 (3.5 months from the last recognized MERS-CoV case in our hospital), the emergency department (ED) evaluated the first case of the current outbreak, which was ongoing through early September 2015."
1050,796943,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was discovered in 1976 in the feces of young pigs with diarrhea, and subsequently demonstrated to induce diarrhea in pigs [1] . Retrospectively, this virus was determined to be the cause of an enteric disease in feeder/fattening pigs that was first described in England in 1971, and characterized by severe watery diarrhea with low mortality [2] . Although endemic PEDV infections have persisted in Europe until the present, the economic impact of the virus is considered to be minor [3] . PEDV was first detected in Asia in 1982 when the virus was isolated in Japan [4] . Within a few years it was recognized in other Southeast Asian countries. In contrast to Europe, the clinical impact of PEDV in Asia was much higher leading to the commercialization of both killed and attenuated vaccines in the late 1990s [5] . Vaccine use may have led to a reduction in prevalence of the disease; however, in 2010 severe PEDV outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality in suckling piglets were reported in China and were subsequently attributed to vaccine failure against new viral PEDV strains [5] [6] [7] ."
1051,1649233,"Upon arrival at our hospital, he had a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6 (E4 V1 M1) with hemodynamically stability. He had obvious neck stiffness. Blood investigation showed an increased white cell count, neutrophil dominant, relatively decreased lymphocytes, increased C-reactive protein. Subsequent investigations included systemic CT demonstrating no evidence of brain edema. The chest CT showed that there was small ground glass opacity on the right superior lobe and both sides of the inferior lobe. On a further lumbar puncture examination, his cerebrospinal fluid was clear and colorless, and the initial pressure was greater than 320 mmH 2 O. The CSF cell count was 12/mL-10 mononuclear and 2 polymorphonuclear cells without red blood cells. Anti-HSV 1 and varicella-zoster IgM antibodies were not detected in serum samples. The RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a nasopharyngeal swab and CSF because we assumed that a SARS-CoV-2 was involved in the outbreak. Although the specific SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in the nasopharyngeal swab, it was detected in CSF (Supplementary Table 1) ."
1052,2548344,"Although the phenomenon of the honeymoon period has been recognized for nearly a hundred years, there have been few, if any, studies directly addressing this issue. It is important to try and understand the underlying mechanisms of this pattern of disease susceptibility. It should be possible to address some of the questions directly in human studies, but it will also be necessary to start developing small animal models to carry out more mechanistic studies. Also, valuable information and insight will come from studies in nonhuman primates using the same pathogens that have shown a difference in their ability to cause disease in children versus adults. The knowledge gained from these studies will provide a better understanding of host-pathogen interactions and better prepare us for dealing with future epidemics and emerging infections."
1053,1565247,"Since the beginning of the new decade of the 21st century-2020, humanity has been burdened by the emergence of a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), which caused a deadly outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1] . The first mention of this novel virus dates from the end of December 2019, and it is linked to a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases (27 cases) recorded in Wuhan, Hubei province, China [2, 3] . The infection was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [4] and became an imperious public health concern."
1054,2471431,"Of the 41 patients in this cohort, 22 (55%) developed severe dyspnoea and 13 (32%) required admission to an intensive care unit, and six died. 7 Hence, the case-fatality proportion in this cohort is approximately 14·6%, and the overall case fatality proportion appears to be closer to 3% (table) . However, both of these estimates should be treated with great caution because not all patients have concluded their illness (ie, recovered or died) and the true number of infections and full disease spectrum are unknown. Importantly, in emerging viral infection outbreaks the case-fatality ratio is often overestimated in the early stages because case detection is highly biased towards the more severe cases. As further data on the spectrum of mild or asymptomatic infection becomes available, one case of which was documented by Chan and colleagues, 6 the case-fatality ratio is likely to decrease. Nevertheless, the 1918 influenza pandemic is estimated to have had a case-fatality ratio of less than 5% 13 but had an enormous impact due to wide spread transmission, so there is no room for complacency."
1055,1796373,"The use of molecular tests for the diagnosis of other flaviviruses can be more problematic; thus for WNV, not only is the viremia of short duration but the titer is considerably lower, with a peak of no more than 1.6 × 10 3 pfu/ml (Hayes, 2005) . A single negative RT-PCR would therefore not rule out a current infection and consequently, serological testing continues to play an important role in laboratory diagnosis in immunocompetent persons. Molecular testing would arguably be of greater usefulness in cases of suspected infection with WNV in immunocompromised patients, where the humoral response may be blunted and the viremia may be prolonged or of higher titer (Huang et al., 2002) . In addition, molecular assays have been used as part of screening for blood and organ donors (CDC, 2005; Health Canada, 2004; Kleinman et al., 2004) . Finally, the use of a single polyvalent flavivirus PCR would be useful for the detection of flaviviruses in various vectors and non-human hosts, to aid in the monitoring of viral activity, including virus emergence."
1056,1312794,"SARS-CoV-2 showed a similar pattern of infection, clinical features and even faster transmission rate [3] than the two coronaviruses have already erupted [4] . However, it is of particular attention that acute lung injury (ALI), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur in SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV infected patients, as well as in severe patients with COVID-19 [5] . Cytokines have been found that play a key role in driving the appearance of these clinical features and are also at the core of inflammation development [6, 7] . Consistent with the previous findings, severe COVID-19 patients showed significantly increased in cytokines such as IL2, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A and TNFα, with the characteristics of a cytokine storm [8] . When SARS-CoV-2 infects the body, the inflammatory response plays an antiviral role, but the strong cytokine storm due to the unbalanced response will make a huge damage on patients. Therefore, taking some strategies to suppress effectively the cytokine storm is an essential way to prevent the deterioration of patients with COVID-19 and save the patients' lives, which is of great significance for the treatment of critically ill patients and reducing the mortality rate. In this review, SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence mechanisms of cytokine storm induced by it will be introduced in detail, including the ways in which cytokines are activated and released, how they cause cell and organ damage, and therapeutic interventions to prevent or quell this harmful process. decreased (83.2%) [17] , and abnormally elevated ALT and AST [24, 25] , proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α increased, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin (PCT) also increased [8] . In addition, patients' plasma angiotensin II (Ang II) levels were significantly increased, which was related to viral load and lung injury [24] ."
1057,2423112,"Various articles have described cohorts of pregnant women with COVID-19 and the demographic information and outcomes of their infants. Zhu and colleagues 4 describe the outcomes of ten neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 infection. The four term and six preterm infants (between 31 and 35 weeks) tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Two of the neonates were critically ill in the NICU and one died because of a presumably unrelated cause. Similarly, Li and colleagues 5 describe a mother who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and gave birth by caesarean section at 35 gestational weeks to a well appearing neonate who tested negative and remained asymptomatic. Another report describes a woman who was 30 weeks pregnant delivering a 1·83 kg infant by caesarean section, who is considered to be the most premature and smallest neonate born to a mother testing positive for COVID-19 reported so far. 6 Amniotic fluid, placenta, cord blood, and nasopharyngeal swab from the neonate tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Chen and colleagues 7 analysed the placentas after delivery of three mothers affected by COVID-19 in the third trimester of pregnancy. All neonatal nasopharyngeal swabs and placentas tested negative. Another study reports four mothers at term with confirmed COVID-19 during the third trimester. 8 All women delivered neonates who were well and asymptomatic, three of whom tested negative for the virus (one neonate was not tested because parental consent was denied). In a report by Chen and colleagues 9 nine women testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 delivered healthy neonates beyond 36 weeks. Cord blood, amniotic fluid, breastmilk, and infants' nasopharyngeal swabs tested negative in the six neonates tested. All samples had been collected at the time of delivery, strongly supporting the absence of vertical transmission. At the time of writing, the shortest time for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in an infant after delivery was 30 h. The infant was born by caesarean section to a mother with confirmed COVID-19, raising the question of vertical transmission. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, and the placenta were unfortunately not analysed. 10 The studies published thus far have not shown vertical transmission and the mode of transmission in our case is most likely to be horizontal. Histological and micro biological analysis of the placenta is currently in process; however, maternal breastmilk tested negative, presumably excluding breastfeeding as the route of transmission. The neonate was delivered by caesarean section and remained in a closed incubator with standard NICU precautions, as COVID-19 was not suspected or diagnosed in the mother until 7 days post partum. The mother wore a surgical mask at all times while present in the NICU, given her yet unidentified febrile illness. Following the COVID-19 diagnosis of mother and infant, the NICU staff and other neonates and parents who had been in the vicinity of, or in direct contact with, the affected mother and neonate were either tested for SARS-CoV-2 or monitored for 14 days. Although we presume horizontal transmission from the mother to the infant, it is vital to consider all potential modes including vertical or congenital transmission, and perinatal or postnatal transmission via aerosol, droplet, and direct contact. This mother-infant pair was diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first stage of the Belgian pandemic, when approximately 250 nationwide cases were confirmed at the time and only two adult patients tested positive and were admitted in our hospital. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the infant was infected by nosocomial spread of aerosolised virus or by an infected health-care worker. There was a single nurse in the NICU who, despite being asymptomatic, tested positive 2 days after the mother-infant diagnosis."

1060,1119704,"Dear Editor, The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a global threat. A fever clinic for triaging patients is a primary strategy against COVID-19 [1] . On January 20, 2020, the novel coronavirus was put on highest alert throughout China. On the same day, a special 24-h fever clinic was set up in the Emergency Department, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). Doctors and nurses for this fever clinic were handpicked by the Emergency Department based on their experience and their adaptability and tenacity under pressure shown in their past works. Psychological support for these medical workers was deemed as essential [2] . Thus, a hotline service was set up by the Department of Psychological Medicine, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day, to talk with medical workers about their feelings, provide support and understanding, and help them find emotional resources. Furthermore, we continuously monitored these medical workers with qualitative and quantitative evaluations, regularly feeding back findings to the Emergency Department to allow for adjustments."
1061,1105061,"Chloroquine is an amine acidotropic form of quinine that was synthesised in Germany by Bayer in 1934 and emerged approximately 70 years ago as an effective substitute for natural quinine [1 , 2] . Quinine is a compound found in the bark of Cinchona trees native to Peru and was the previous drug of choice against malaria [3] . For decades, chloroquine was a front-line drug for the treatment and prophylaxis of malaria and is one of the most prescribed drugs worldwide [4] . Chloroquine and the 4-aminoquinoline drug hydroxychloroquine belong to the same molecular family. Hydroxychloroquine differs from chloroquine by the presence of a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain: the N -ethyl substituent is βhydroxylated. This molecule is available for oral administration in the form of hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Hydroxychloroquine has pharmacokinetics similar to that of chloroquine, with rapid gastrointestinal absorption and renal elimination. However, the clinical indications and toxic doses of these drugs slightly differ. In malaria, the indication for chloroquine was a high dose for a short period of time (due to its toxicity at high doses) or a low dose for a long period of time. Hydroxychloroquine was reported to be as active as chloroquine against Plasmodium falciparum malaria and less toxic, but it is much less active than chloroquine against chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum owing to its physicochemical properties. What is advantageous with hydroxychloroquine is that it can be used in high doses for long periods with very good tolerance. Unfortunately, the efficacy of chloroquine gradually declined due to the continuous emergence of chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains [5] . Chloroquine is also utilised in the treatment of autoimmune diseases [6] . Yet the activity of the molecule is not limited to malaria and the control of inflammatory processes, as illustrated by its broad-spectrum activity against a range of bacterial, fungal and viral infections [7] [8] [9] [10] . Indeed, in the mid-1990s, due to its tolerability, rare toxicity reports, inexpensive cost and immunomodulatory properties [11] , chloroquine repurposing was explored against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other viruses associated with inflammation and was found to be efficient in inhibiting their replication cycle [12] ."
1062,1174142,"The development of countermeasures to viral threats requires significant time and investment, and it is unlikely that these would be developed during the initial Global Virome Project phases. The recently launched Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations represents a critical step to address known viral threats, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Lassa fever and Nipah virus, for which vaccine or countermeasure development is challenging. 20 The Global Virome Project aims to complement the coalitions' innovations by characterizing the size, structure and composition of the pool of unknown viruses related to the viral targets on which the coalition is focused. For example, if a candidate vaccine against Middle East respiratory syndrome could be tested against hundreds of near relatives of that same syndrome, vaccines that have broader prevention capacity could be selected and rolled out to provide better protection against future emergence of this syndrome. This approach could enhance biotechnological efforts to move from single-virus countermeasures to ones that target a whole family of viruses. 21"
1063,2676879,"We declare no competing interests. We would like to express our concern about the limited capacity of actions taken by the Spanish Government to successfully control the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak and end the exponential growth phase of new cases. The measures taken so far, consisting primarily of partial restriction mobility, are in the right direction, although some researchers have warned about the pressure placed on the building blocks of the health system. 1 Given that the actual extent of an epidemic can only be assessed retrospectively, governments and policy makers are forced to make decisions on the basis of mathematical models of other diseases and previous experiences by other countries taking different actions. 2 In Spain, various models simulating the spread of infection and using different assumptions converge in a landscape of a high number of new cases within the next few weeks. Simulations have been done using the URV and UNIZAR models to predict the progression of the number of patients who will require admission into hospital intensive care units because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in three scenarios (appendix): scenario 1, no mobility restrictions; scenario 2, partial restriction of mobility (ie, movement to the workplace allowed for 30% of people); and scenario 3, complete restriction of mobility (ie, no workplace mobility allowed except for essential services)."
1064,2481562,"Mutations at the putative GP1-NPC1 interface have been previously demonstrated to reduce GP1-NPC1 interaction and greatly impair infectivity (22, 47, 48) . Recent work has shown that proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site, com-prising a basic/polar crest overhanging a deep hydrophobic trough (65) . We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GP⌬Muc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65) . Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B ). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). NPC1's functionality as a cholesterol transporter may also have some bearing on EBOV entry, as GP-mediated lipid mixing is selectively inhibited by the cationic amphiphile U18666A (Fig. 4C) , which induces an NPC1 disease phenotype marked by cholesterol accumulation within late endosomes and lysosomes (20, 49) . GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20) , suggesting that this block is due to the drug's specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion."
1065,1498407,"For the COVID-19 patients with diabetes, tailored therapeutic strategy and optimal goal of glucose control should be formulated based on clinical classification, coexisting comorbidities, age and other risk factors. Blood glucose should be controlled for all patients during hospitalization to monitor the progress of illness and avoid aggravation. For critical cases, early identification and timely reduction adverse drug reaction (for instance, glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycemia) could prevent worse symptoms. During the 4-week follow-up period after discharge, blood glucose homeostasis should be maintained continuously and patients need to avoid infectious diseases due to a lower immune response. Long-term follow-up is still essential for diabetic patients to reduce diabetes-related complications and mortality. With the aim of preventing person-to-person transmission, a variety of online services of glucose management have been implemented widely for diabetic patients and general population during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. The popularization of Internet and smartphones, as well as emerging fifth generation networks, have ensured endocrinologists to provide remote medical consultation for the patients who are not advised to go to the hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, free educational videos and e-books on diabetes self-management and COVID-19 prevention have been provided for the public via WeChat mobile app. To date, these online services and resources have played remarkable roles in the nationwide COVID-19 control in China."

Rapid diagnostic also facilitates other specific public health interventions such as closure of high-risk facilities and areas associated with the confirmed cases for prompt infection control and environmental decontamination [11, 101] ."

Additionally, the model explicitly accounts for asymptomatic carriers and subacute and critical hospitalizations. As such, the MAGE framework is more complex than simple SIR compartmental models (e.g. [6] ), and contains explicit information relevant for policy making, but is less complex than other more detailed approaches, e.g., agent based modeling approaches [5] . A potential benefit of the MAGE framework is that it remains reasonably tractable both philosophically -it is possible to see and understand the rules that drive epidemiological dynamics; but also computationally. These characteristics may be appealing for policy makers [29] and for future modeling efforts [30] ."

1069,2706275,"We tried to determine if this antibody-dependent enhancement also occurred in SARS-CoV-infected HL-CZ cells. Our data indicate that treatment with anti-sera collected from SARS-CoV patients and diluted 1000-to 2000-fold resulted in increased virus infectivity and CPE compared to treatment with 10-fold diluted anti-sera (Fig. 2B ). According to transmission electron microscopy images, higher quantities of SARS-CoV viral particles were observed in HL-CZ cells treated with more diluted anti-sera against SARS-CoV (2000-fold dilution) (Fig. 2C-3 ) compared to those treated with less diluted anti-sera (10-fold) (Fig. 2C-1 ) and less diluted normal control sera (10-fold) (Fig. 2C-2) . We performed additional infectivity assays to confirm this observation, and found significantly higher levels of virus infection following treatment with 100-and 1000-fold diluted anti-sera compared to control sera from non-SARS-CoV patients at the same dilutions (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3A) . We also found that highly diluted anti-sera against SARS-CoV significantly increased virus-induced apoptosis in HL-CZ cells compared to normal sera at the same dilutions (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B )."
1070,952255,"The human bocavirus was initially discovered in 2005 [1] and has been associated with serious infections of the respiratory tract and gastrointestinal disease [2] . Although Koch's postulates could not be fulfilled for human bocavirus so far, there is increasing evidence that it is a true pathogen rather than an innocent bystander in airway infection (reviewed by [3] [4] ). Recently, we and others have shown that acute HBoV infection can lead to a persistent infection [5] [6] [7] leading to covalently closed circular HBoV genomes in infected cells [6] . It becomes a likely hypothesis that chronic HBoV infection could lead to ongoing, maybe subclinical inflammation processes that finally lead to fibrosis of the chronically infected tissue, as observed for other DNA viruses like hepatitis B virus infections [8] . It might also be speculated that persistent infection HBoV could be responsible for chronic idiopathic interstitial lung diseases such as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)."
1071,199020,"From exposome-to infectome-induced autoimmunity Infectious and non-infectious agents comprise environmental triggers [5, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] . Non-infectious triggers are numerous, and some examples from our literature search can be found in Table 1 [42, . An infectious burden in autoimmunity has been documented and the triggers are numerous, including bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi, with variations on particular organisms being found from one autoimmune disease to the next [5, 76, 77] . Geo-epidemiological, microbiological and immunological data indicate the existence of infectious burdens varying from one autoimmune disease to another. Autoantibody burdens in infected individuals have also been noted, but these individuals have not been followed-up for long and it is not know how many of those could develop autoimmune disease [78] . We define the group of disease-causing or disease-linked infections as the ''infectome''. Alterations in the presence of these organisms or the body's immune response to them would also be noted, such as in the case of treatment with antibiotics [79, 80] or exposure to xenobiotics [81] [82] [83] . Such exposures may alter the disease course or its progression by altering the flora present. In contrast to the hygiene hypothesis which supports a protective role played by infections [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] , work on clinical biomaterial and experimental animal models of autoimmune diseases clearly demonstrates that infectious agents break immunological tolerance to self-antigens and can induce autoimmune disease [5] . Examples include acute rheumatic fever presenting several weeks after infection with Streptococcus pyogenes [89] , Helicobacter pylori and autoimmune gastritis [90] , as well as between Trypanosoma cruzi and Chagas' cardiomyopathy [91] , and Mycoplasma with rheumatoid arthritis [92] . These exposures likely begin as early as the transfer of maternal antibodies via the placenta or via breast milk in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is important to identify which of these exposures contributes to the development of disease. It is also important to highlight differences with the microbiome, which identified all microorganisms in a particular region, but is unable to identify those which cause (or protect from) the development and/or progression of a disease. It is also a measure which occurs at a single time point, and thus, only gives a snapshot of which organisms are present throughout a lifetime. Likewise, environmental factors may influence the development of autoimmunity by infectious agents through several routes. The co-expression of xenobiotics or metals, such as nickel, aluminium or mercury, for example, which are now ubiquitous in our environment and a constant part of the human exposome, may act as adjuvants to the immune system. If this occurs in anatomical positions, such as the oral cavity, which is key to the development of oral tolerance through various dental interventions, it may have vast ramification for the development of immunity and autoimmunity. Likewise, the effects of metals have not been fully studied on the human gut microbiome. Potential damage to the gut microflora has potentially extensive implications for the protective role of these floras against pathogen invasion as well as the interactions of the microflora with the mucosal-associated immune system. Mercury is well known for its immunomodulating effects and is frequently used in experimental models for inducing immune reactions (e.g. mercuric chloride model for vasculitis). It also is known to have immunosuppressive effects, and this in its own right may impair the immune system's response to infections (Fig. 1) ."
1072,1617908,"Multiple studies have confirmed the presence of SARS-nCoV-2 RNA in the stool of COVID-19 patients, including some who never tested positive in the upper respiratory tract. Additionally, the virus appears to persist in stool on average 11 days (and for up to a full month) after throat swabs become negative, and well after clinical recovery. 5 Sound conceptual arguments but limited evidence implicate endoscopy as a possible hotspot for viral transmission. 9 Droplet contamination, based on bacterial culture swabs, has been demonstrated up to 6 feet away during colonoscopy. Additionally, viral aerosolization via peri-or intra-procedural coughing, retching, flatus, or even endoscope insertion and removal and accessory channel use is postulated. Based on these concepts and data from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, the American Gastroenterological Association has published guidelines recommending N95 (or equivalent) respirators for all upper and lower endoscopic procedures. 10 Additional recommendations include double gloving and the use of negative pressure rooms for endoscopy in patients with known or suspected COVID-19. While earlier guidance favored a risk-stratified approach to using surgical masks versus N95 respirators, evolving knowledge of how the virus is transmitted and broad evidence of community spread now mandate maximal protection, including the universal use of hairnets, face shields, and shoe covers."
1073,2774538,"Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide prodrug that has broad antiviral activity against viruses from different families in vitro (4) , and therapeutic efficacy in nonhuman primate models of lethal Ebola virus and Nipah virus infection (5, 6) . Studies in human airway epithelial cells showed that remdesivir also inhibits replication of a wide range of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV (7) . Efficacy studies in mice showed that remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV in Ces1c −/− mice, deficient in a secreted carboxylesterase responsible for poor pharmacokinetics profile of remdesivir in mice, when administered before the peak of virus replication (7, 8) . In vitro studies with mouse hepatitis virus showed that remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication through interference with the viral polymerase, despite the presence of a viral proofreading exoribonuclease (9) . Importantly, coronaviruses partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir, obtained in vitro following >20 passages in the presence of GS-441524, a parent nucleoside that is metabolized into the same active triphosphate metabolite, were still sensitive to higher concentrations of remdesivir, and fitness was impaired in the resistant viruses as compared to wild-type MERS-CoV (9) . With these promising data in mind, we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque (10) ."

1075,1287905,"Respiratory infections in transplantation medicine will continue to pose significant obstacles with associated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. The high morbidity and mortality observed from emerging infections stem from protean manifestations of disease, which delay diagnosis as well as appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Early institution and maintenance of antimicrobial therapy is often restricted by toxicity and interactions with necessary immunosuppressive drugs. Also, limited data on effective antimicrobial regimens exist, with most therapeutic strategies based on anecdotal experiences."
1076,2039652,"A recent report on 175 patients who recovered from COVID-19 showed that nAb titers were moderately correlated with antibodies binding to S protein domains (24) . Surprisingly, 30% of patients developed only low titers of nAbs after recovery, with younger patients (15 to 39 years of age) having significantly lower anti-SARS-CoV-2 and nAb titers. This suggest that innate and adaptive cellular immunity are also likely to play a significant role in viral clearance and immunity to coronaviruses (71) ."
1077,1818871,"The premature cell death triggered by the inhibition of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w prevents the development of cellular antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses that are initiated by cellular PPRs such as RIG-I (retinoic acid inducible gene-I) and MDA5 in response to viral components. [27] [28] [29] Surprisingly, we found several PPRs (such as LRRFIP2, DHX9, H2B and components of TLR4-signalling pathway such as FLII, LRRFIP2 and TOLLIP) associated with Bcl-xL in mock-and IAV-infected human RPE cells.

Additionally, although in Peru the case fatality rate of dengue is lower than that of COVID-19, some clinical manifestations such as dengue with alarm signs and severe dengue may need hospitalization and ICU admission (according to Peruvian guidelines [4] ). To make matters worse, the number of probable cases has followed a similar pattern to that of confirmed cases, with an approximate ratio of 2:1, which increases, even more, the demand for healthcare services and resources in the country. In Peru, drastic measures have been implemented in order to achieve the mitigation of the impact of COVID-19/Dengue. These included the publication of two supreme decrees (N � 044-2020-PCM and N � 004-2020-SA). However, different limitations have arisen, especially since the first case of COVID-19 was reported.

The latter is a more sensitive assay of NFkB nuclear translocation upon viral infection. To examine potential direct effects of Nsp1 on NFkB nuclear translocation and AP-1, HEK 293 and Jurkat cells were cotransfected with SARS-CoV Nsp1fl and p55A2luc containing repeated PRDII elements or pAP-1-luc containing the AP-1 binding site of the IL-2 promoter ( Figure 7) . Overexpression of Nsp1fl as well as treatment with PMA/ionomycin, respectively, caused small but significant luciferase increases in both cell lines. The combined expression of Nsp1fl with PMA/ionomycin treatment led to significant induction of PRDII by a factor of about 6 in both cell lines. The AP-1 promotor was only slightly upregulated in HEK293 and downregulated in Jurkat cells. This indicated a coinvolvement of NFkB but not of AP-1 in the induction of IL-2 by Nsp1, suggesting dependence mainly on the NFAT pathway. In summary, SARS-CoV caused relevant and specific induction of IL-2 by activating the NFAT pathway via Nsp1."

Nanoelectrospray ionization was used in the analysis of all samples. Spectra were collected at 400-2000 m/z with a resolution of 100 k and analyzed using the accurate mass and elution time (AMT) tag approach (Smith et al., 2002) . The mass de-isotoping process was performed using Decon2LS (Jaitly et al., 2009) , and the matching process was performed using VIPER (Monroe et al., 2007) . Features from the LC-MS analyses were matched to AMT tags to identify peptides, using an initial tolerance of ±3 p.p.m. for mass and 2.5% for the LC normalized elution time (NET). The human cell culture peptide datasets were further processed to remove peptides identified with low confidence, using the uniqueness filter Statistical Likelihood Confidence (SLiC) (Anderson et al., 2006) score of 0.35 and a DelSLiC of 0.2. In circumstances where a peptide was identified in some LC-MS analyses, but not others, the missing data were coded as 'NaN'. All peptide abundance values were transformed to the log10 scale. Minimum occurrence data filters were used to identify those peptides for which the amount of data present was not adequate for differential abundance analysis (Webb-Robertson et al., 2010) .

1091,2399926,"The RdRps encoded by some -RNA viruses, including the heterotrimeric RdRp of IAV, can perform both de novo initiation as well as primer-dependent initiation. The de novo mechanism is used to start the synthesis of cRNAs from vRNAs (Fig. 1) . In turn, these cRNAs can be used as template for the production of new vRNAs. This latter process utilises a prime-realign mechanism that depends on high concentrations of initiating NTPs [91] . These initiating NTPs base pair with positions ?4 and ?5 of the cRNA 3 0 terminus [91] and then translocate to bases ?1 and ?2 after the first nucleotide condensation as dinucleotide pppApG.

1092,2625483,"Preliminary epidemiological observations support a faecooral route of transmission. This is supported by a recent experimental study in which three 9-10-month-old Japanese draught horses were successfully infected via nasooesophageal intubation using faecal material from a previously characterised ECoV infected horse (Nemoto et al. 2014 ) Two of the three draught horses developed clinical disease and all shed large amounts of ECoV in faeces. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is closely related to ECoV and considered a pneumoenteric virus, causing not only enteric disease but also mild upper respiratory signs (Saif et al. 1986; Tsunemitsu et al. 1999; Tr av en et al. 2001; O'Neill et al. 2014) . Recently, a French group screened 395 faeces and 200 respiratory specimens submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory for the presence of ECoV (Miszczak et al. 2014) . The samples had been collected from foals and adult horses suffering from mild respiratory or enteric disease. In that study, the researchers found ECoV by qPCR in a total of 12 samples (11 faecal samples and one respiratory specimen). In a preliminary study testing nasal secretions from 2437 horses with signs of fever and/or acute onset of upper respiratory tract infection submitted to a commercial diagnostic laboratory in the USA from January 2013 to December 2014 for the detection of common respiratory pathogens, ECoV was detected by qPCR in only 17 (0.7%) horses (N. Pusterla, personal communication 2015) . Collectively, both these studies show that ECoV is infrequently detected in nasal secretions from horses with infectious upper respiratory tract disease, suggesting lack of tropism for ECoV to the respiratory epithelium. In the three experimentally-infected Japanese draught horses (Nemoto et al. 2014) , nasal secretions were ECoV PCR positive during the time of peak faecal shedding but it could not be determined if this was due to nasal replication and shedding of the virus or from environmental contamination from the positive faeces or both. Morbidity of ECoV in affected herds is variable and has been reported to range between 10 and 83% (Oue et al. 2011 (Oue et al. , 2013 Pusterla et al. 2013; Fielding et al. 2015) . Mortality rates have been reported to be low (Oue et al. 2011 (Oue et al. , 2013 Pusterla et al. 2013) , although a mortality rate of 27% was recently reported by Fielding et al. (2015) in American miniature horses. A recent outbreak investigated by the AHDC on an additional American miniature horse breeding farm found laboratory confirmed ECoV cases that developed serious but nonfatal illness (L. Mittel, personal communication 2015). The apparent increased susceptibility to ECoV disease in American miniature horses needs to be further investigated."
1093,1027522,"While 'outcome-neutral' approaches using mRNA motifs known to promote efficient PRF cannot identify new classes of frameshift signals, they enable an expansion of our understanding of operational uses for PRF. The seminal study in this field searched the yeast genome for operational À1 ribosomal frameshift (À1 RF) promoting motifs resembling well characterized examples of viral À1 RF signals, identifying $260 putative such elements (9) . This work was limited by incomplete annotation of the yeast genome and insufficient computational resources available at the time. New bioinformatics tools were subsequently developed and applied using faster and more robust computational platforms. The results showed that: pattern matching approaches coupled with a predictive method for folding RNA sequences provided a dramatic improvement in the results; À1 RF motifs are widespread in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and many have predicted secondary structures with statistically significant measures of free energy (15) . This analysis showed that $11% of yeast genes contain at least one high probability À1 RF signal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nine putative À1 RF signals selected from a variety of S. cerevisiae genes/genome promoted efficient recoding in vivo. More recently, this bioinformatics protocol has been applied to additional genomes. Currently, more than 25 genomes have been analyzed and it appears that 8-12% of genes contain at least one potential À1 RF signal (see PRFdB at http://prfdb.umd.edu/) (17) ."

Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. In addition to these positive effects, dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. The lactate-lowering effect of dapagliflozin may not be a class effect and other SGLT2 inhibitors may not have a lactate-lowering effect [11] . Dapagliflozin reduces lactate release from epicardial adipose tissue [12] . It reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production [6] . Also, it increases urinary lactate excretion [13] . It has been reported that the combination of dapagliflozin with drugs that increase the lactate level, such as metformin, prevents hyperlactatemia [12] . A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H þ symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained [7, 8] . Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE [14] . Thus, Na þ and Ca þ2 flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin will lower the increased lactate level as a result of increased LDH due to cell destruction in COVID-19 infection. Unlike the binding of the virus to hemoglobin and leaving the tissues to deoxygenated will further increase lactate production, dapagliflozin may prevent damage and die of the cells, both by increasing tissue oxygenation and by decreasing the lactate level. Dapagliflozin inhibits NHE and prevents the pH of the cells from decreasing and shows a cytoprotective effect. Also, SGLT2 inhibitors increase the ACE2 level [15, 16] . ACE2 forms angiotensin 1-7 from angiotensin II. Angiotensin 1-7 is a potent vasodilator. It has been reported that angiotensin 1e7 may be protective against acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Increased ACE2 increases the angiotensin 1-7 level, however, increased ACE2 can also be harmful by causing an increase in viral load [1, 4, 17] . Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load. Therefore, an increase in ACE2 may be useful in preventing ARDS by increasing the angiotensin 1-7 level. It may also alleviate the cytokine storms due to the virus."

The genome contains two large open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b , encoding two polyproteins leading to the viral replicase formation. Downstream to the ORF1b, there are 8 Á/10 smaller ORFs encoding for the structural proteins S (ORF2), E (ORF4), M (ORF5) and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Enjuanes et al., 2000) ."
1097,125639,"There is no doubt that our study has important limitations. First, this was a small retrospective and uncontrolled case series with limited follow-up. All patients were symptomatic, indicating that asymptomatic cases were probably missed. For the antiretroviral treatment regimen, we did not have the precise rates of overall PI or tenofovir prescriptions in the participating centers. Other important data were incomplete, including transmission and exposure conditions. In addition, detailed information about the onset, duration, intensity of the symptoms, and radiological details of CT scans were limited or not obtained in our retrospective analysis."
1098,1858506,"The second half of the meeting was devoted to non-traditional aspects of nucleolar research, starting with how viruses use nucleolar proteins and functions for their own ends. It has been known for some years that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transports its mRNA through the nucleolus, but J. Rossi (Duarte, CA, USA) outlined how this property can be used against HIV. He showed that U16 snoRNAs carrying anti-HIV RNAs to the nucleolus interfere with the transport of HIV RNA. In the first example presented by Rossi, an anti-HIV-1-targeted hammerhead ribozyme fused to the U16 snoRNA effectively ablated the cytoplasmic accumulation of some of the HIV RNA transcripts. This approach was used to generate T-cell lines that could not be infected with HIV-1. The second approach was to place a transactivation response (TAR) decoy sequence into a second hybrid U16 snoRNA. The TAR sequence is recognized by the HIV protein Tat, which has a key role in viral mRNA transcription and is localized to the nucleolus. Flooding the nucleolus with false TAR sequences severely compromised the ability of the virus to replicate. Again, T-cell lines expressing this decoy could not be infected by HIV-1. Clinical trials are planned in which haematopoietic stem cells will be transduced by a viral vector expressing a snoRNA TAR decoy and small interfering RNAs to knock down the cellular co-receptor for HIV, CCR5. The resulting cells will be reintroduced into the patient, in whom the transduced stem cells would repopulate the body with immune cells resistant to infection by HIV (Li et al, 2005) . The team plans to use HIV-1-based lentiviral gene therapy vectors to introduce the anti-HIV RNAs into the stem cells."
1099,2814602,"During translational elongation, the paired codon and anticodon can sometimes disengage at certain sequences, allowing the mRNA to slip with respect to the ribosomepeptidyl-tRNA complex. The anticodon may then re-pair with a now-nearby similar codon, so that synthesis continues downstream. On a run of 4 identical bases the reengagement may occur at a codon 1 base removed from the original in-frame codon, with a resultant frameshift. ""Slipping"" of this type is part of the mechanism for many of the examples of -1 or +l frameshifting described below."
1100,3144493,"40 41 SUMMARY 42 The outbreaks of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by 43 SARS-CoV-2 infection has posed a severe threat to global public health. It is unclear 44 how the human immune system responds to this infection. Here, we used 45 metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the bronchoalveolar 46 lavage fluid of eight COVID-19 cases. The expression of proinflammatory genes, 47 especially chemokines, was markedly elevated in COVID-19 cases compared to 48 community-acquired pneumonia patients and healthy controls, suggesting that 49 SARS-CoV-2 infection causes hypercytokinemia. Compared to SARS-CoV, which is 50 thought to induce inadequate interferon (IFN) responses, SARS-CoV-2 robustly 51 triggered expression of numerous IFN-inducible genes (ISGs). These ISGs exhibit 52 immunopathogenic potential, with overrepresentation of genes involved in 53 inflammation. The transcriptome data was also used to estimate immune cell 54 populations, revealing increases in activated dendritic cells and neutrophils."
1101,1464060,"A mean ENC value of 48.54 ± 2.34 was obtained for SARS-CoV-2 strains enrolled in these studies, suggesting that the overall codon usage among SARS-CoV-2 is similar among themselves and slightly biased. This is in agreement with mean ENC values obtained for other CoV, like SARS-CoV (ENC = 48.99) (Gu et al., 2004) ; Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) (ENC = 43.78) (Castells et al., 2017) ; MERS-CoV (ENC = 55.50) (Alnazawi et al., 2017) or Avian CoV (ENC = 51.33) (NSP2; Brandao, 2013) . ENC-GC3s plot of the values obtained for SARS-CoV-2 revealed that all spots cluster below the expected curve, suggesting that G+C compositional constraints play a role in SARS-CoV-2 (see Fig. 3 )."
1102,1133358,"By contrast with findings in adults, children with COVID-19 had milder clinical manifestations; nearly half of paediatric patients were asymptomatic (ie, no fever and no cough). This asymptomatic condition is relevant if community-acquired transmission becomes the primary mode; identification of paediatric patients without presenting symptoms will become a great challenge. Fortunately, the number of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 accounted for a small proportion of total people infected, and paediatric patients also had clear epidemiological information. Devising measures to protect children from infection with SARS-CoV-2 is very important."
1103,2447254,"To prove that the rescued viruses were indeed from the tranfected synthetic RNAs, IFA were conducted. As shown in Fig. 2 , the supernatant of the transfected cells contains PRRSV viruses, evidenced by positive staining of the infected cells against Nsp2 monoclonal antibody of PRRSV. In addition, the result indicated that all mutant viruses including vORF12 (Panel A), v5ND7 (B), vORF56c (C), vORF673 (D), and vORF7Ua (E) shared the similar Nsp2 distribution pattern with the parental virus (data not shown). These results demonstrated that the rescued viruses from all full-length mutant cDNA clones were PRRSV-specific, as no staining was detected in negative control (Fig. 2 , Panel F)."

1105,346382,"with APC in the absence of any treatment decreased viral infectivity by approximately 0Á5-1 log 10 . Following photochemical treatment, SARS-CoV was consistently inactivated to the limit of detection in seven independent APC units. No infectious virus was detected after treatment when up to one-third of the APC unit was assayed, demonstrating a mean log 10 -reduction of >6Á2. Potent inactivation of SARS-CoV therefore extends the capability of the INTERCEPT Blood System in inactivating a broad spectrum of human pathogens including recently emerging respiratory viruses."
1106,123466,"In order to support this objective, we developed a process to utilize inpatient telemedicine video visits and electronic consultation (eConsults) to assess patients with non-procedural urological needs presenting to the emergency department (ED) or admitted to the hospital. We aim to describe these types of remote consultation, medical documentation and billing requirements, and demonstrate a process for rapid implementation. Our hope is that other consulting specialists can implement similar programs, contribute to PPE preservation, and minimize unnecessary physical exposure without compromising medical care."
1107,1231487,"The level of expression observed under the control of the GAL1 promoter was higher than that observed under the control of the PGK promoter, although the latter is known to be one of the most efficient yeast promoters when acting with its natural gene (Mellor ef al., 1985) . Comparison of the yeast (Sharp efa/., 1986) and the TGEV nucleoprotein codon usage showed that there was little difference in codon usage (data not shown), which should not cause any reduction in efficiency of expression. The presence of yeast transcription termination sequences has been found to enhance the efficiency of expression. The expression plasmid containing the PGK promoter contains a termination site downstream of the cloning site used, whereas the plasmid containing the GAL1 promoter contains no yeast termination sequence. No apparent increase in expression was observed between the products from the GAL 1 promoter in the presence or absence of the PGK terminator."
1108,2967507,"Owing to its central role in regulating multiple cell signaling pathways, modulation of NFKB activity has been an attractive target of many viral factors in order to allow them to exploit the host cell signaling machinery to their benefit. We have identified the ability of the ORF2 protein of the HEV to inhibit host cell NFKB activity. However, whether such an event is recapitulated during the natural course of HEV infection and whether it is crucial for the virus induced pathogenic effects, can be answered only by performing similar experiments using a model organism infected with the wild type virus. Nevertheless, the present study confirms the NFKB inhibitory property of the HEV ORF2 protein and provides some evidence suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying this event."
1109,637132,"Findings After the initial phase of exponential growth, the rate of confirmed cases fell to less than 20 per day by April 28. Public-health interventions included encouragement to report to hospital rapidly after the onset of clinical symptoms, contact tracing for confirmed and suspected cases, and quarantining, monitoring, and restricting the travel of contacts. The mean incubation period of the disease is estimated to be 6·4 days (95% CI 5·2-7·7). The mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to admission to hospital varied between 3 and 5 days, with longer times earlier in the epidemic. The estimated case fatality rate was 13·2% (9·8-16·8) for patients younger than 60 years and 43·3% (35·2-52·4) for patients aged 60 years or older assuming a parametric ␥ distribution. A non-parametric method yielded estimates of 6·8% (4·0-9·6) and 55·0% (45·3-64·7), respectively. Case clusters have played an important part in the course of the epidemic."
1110,920389,"Some viruses were mainly present as co-infecting agents (hRV, IV, hBoV, AdV and hMPV) and rarely found as single pathogens. As previously reported [3, 29, 30] , RSV was the most frequent pathogen in both cohorts, especially in younger children. The second virus most frequently detected by PCR was hRV. The clinical significance of a positive hRV PCR assay has been questioned, given that hRV has been detected in asymptomatic children even two weeks after the clinical symptoms had disappeared [31, 32] . However, hRV has been identified as single pathogen in some ARIs in children [21] . In our study, hRV was found in one third of samples and as single pathogen in approximately 10% of the cases."
1111,2865236,"We estimated the likely effects of current job losses on the number of uninsured persons by using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's March 2019 Current Population Survey on health insurance coverage rates among persons who lost or left a job. The uninsurance rate among unemployed persons who had lost or left a job was 26.3% versus 10.7% among those with jobs. Applying the 15.6 -percentage point difference to the 9.955 million who filed new unemployment claims last week, we estimate that 1.553 million newly unemployed persons will lose health coverage. This figure excludes family members who will become uninsured because a breadwinner lost coverage and self-employed persons who may lose coverage because their businesses were shuttered, but are ineligible for unemployment benefits. If, as the Federal Reserve economist projects, an additional 47.05 million people become unemployed, 7.3 million workers (along with several million family members) are likely to join the ranks of the U.S. uninsured population."
1112,2308967,"The generation interval, denoted by τ, is the time from symptom onset in a primary case to symptom onset in a secondary case. Sometimes this generation interval is called the serial interval (8) or generation time (11) . The generation intervals observed during the SARS outbreak in Singapore are well described by a Weibull distribution with a shape parameter α and a scale parameter β, with values corresponding to a mean generation interval of 8.4 days and a standard deviation of 3.8 days (8) . We denote this distribution by τ ∼ w(τ|α,β)."
1113,1971188,"We encoded all information available in the first 3 hours after admission for a large cohort comparable with other published cohorts in terms of the distribution of causal microbial pathogens, patient characteristics and severity of disease [15] [16] [17] . We demonstrated that experienced clinicians synthesizing all this information failed to adequately answer the question: ""is it a viral or a bacterial pneumonia?"", as the discriminant ability between the two diagnoses was considered low. We interpreted our results mainly based on the calculation of likelihood ratios, as recommended for reports of a diagnostic test for an infectious disease [12] . Likelihood ratios incorporate both sensitivity and specificity and, unlike predictive values, do not vary with prevalence, making them good statistical tools to facilitate translation of knowledge from research to clinical practice [12] . In parallel, we designed a data-driven approach. Different AI methods were available; we selected the Random Forest method because it is one of the most efficient strategies for providing a predictive algorithm in this context [18] [19] [20] [21] . Importantly, the final algorithm was tasked with providing predictions for a novel population independent of the dataset used for the algorithm construction. The discriminant abilities of the AI approach restricted to the binary choice ""viral"" or ""bacterial"" were superior to those of experts but still considered low or moderate and were ultimately insufficient to provide an indisputable therapeutic decision. It is important to emphasize that we chose a high cutoff value for determining the discriminant ability of the AI approach (LR+ > 10, LR-< 0.1); this choice was made for two reasons. First, in this proof-ofconcept study, we did not analyze co-infections and restricted the possible choices to a binary prediction. Because we reduced the complexity of the cases, we expected high predictive performances. Second, the goal of this study was not a prediction of outcomes (e.g., ICU length of stay, mortality), which are informative but do not determine patient management; it was to provide a clear and immediate medical decision: whether or not to prescribe antibiotics. The immediate clinical consequences in this situation demand a high predictive performance. Still, it is important to highlight that the machine learning method we developed achieved an AUC of 0.84, which is superior or at least equal to AUC values usually observed for predictive mathematical models developed for the ICU environment. For instance, the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) have AUC values of 0.61, 0.70 and 0.73, respectively, for identifying sepsis [22] . An AI Sepsis Expert algorithm for early prediction of sepsis has been engineered and achieved AUC values ranging from 0.83-0.85 according to the time of the prediction. An AI method for predicting prolonged mechanical ventilation achieved an AUC of 0.82 [23] . How can it be that AI or machine-learning predictive algorithms that can already automatically drive cars or successfully understand human speech failed to predict the microbial cause of pneumonia accurately? First, having data of excellent quality is critical for the success of AI predictions. The ICU environment is data-rich, providing fertile soil for the development of accurate predictive models [24] , but it is also a challenging environment with heterogeneous and complex data. In our study, the data that fueled the AI method were from a real-world data source. It is probably more difficult to create a consistent data format when merging data from interviews, patient examinations, biological and radiological information than when using datasets from the insurance or finance industries. Additionally, data arising from patient examinations and interviews are still strictly dependent on the physician's skill and experience. Finally, although we hypothesized that the AI capabilities would exceed human skills and make accurate predictions when physicians cannot, we must also consider the null hypothesis: viral and bacterial pneumonias share the same characteristics and cannot be distinguished based on initial clinical, biological or radiological parameters. The dividing lines between the signs and symptoms of a viral versus a bacterial infection could be too blurry to permit the two diagnoses to be discerned without microbial analyses."
1114,667327,"Nucleic acid amplification tests have shown increased sensitivity and faster reporting compared to non-amplification tests. 7 The higher detection rates is attributable both due to the inclusion of large number of viral targets, including newly identified viruses for which culture and/or DFA is not available, and also due to the increased sensitivity allowing detection of low levels of virus. 2, 3, [6] [7] [8] [9] 15 The latter is especially important in older adults because of shedding of low titers of viruses as compared to children that typically shed larger titers. 22, 23 Ultimately, accurate diagnosis will optimize antiviral treatment and implementation of infection control and public health measures. 16 New commercial systems are now available ensuring standardization and quality control. 7, 24 The xTAG has shown better performance compared to DFA, 24 however comparative data with other newer commercial multiplex PRV assays is lacking."

Thus, seven cases with Salmonella spp. infection were recorded governorates of river Nile delta region. However, two cases only were recovered from calves raised in semiarid region of Behrra governorate. This result could be due to the system of management of calves, and the nature of environment. The farms located in Behera governorate is a semi arid region. Moreover, the farms were away from other human and animal buildings. This result is supported by that described by Davison et al. (2006) who recorded significant association between the region and prevalence of Salmonella infection in cattle. In a study carried out by Sidhu et al. (2008) it was found that viability of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium was affected by direct exposure to the sunlight, especially during summer. It is suggested that interaction of more than one factor could contribute for the occurrence of Salmonella spp. infection in newborn calves."
1117,1903530,"Post-mortem analysis of the transplanted kidney by electron microscopy revealed viral inclusion structures in endothelial cells ( figure  A, B) . In histological analyses, we found an accumulation of inflammatory cells associated with endothelium, as well as apoptotic bodies, in the heart, the small bowel (figure C) and lung (figure D). An accumulation of mononuclear cells was found in the lung, and most small lung vessels appeared congested. Patient 2 was a woman, aged 58 years, with diabetes, arterial hypertension, and obesity. She developed progressive respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and subsequently developed multi-organ failure and needed renal replace ment therapy. On day 16, mesenteric ischaemia prompted removal of necrotic small intestine. Circulatory failure occurred in the setting of right heart failure consequent to an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, and cardiac arrest resulted in death. Post-mortem histology revealed lymphocytic endotheliitis in lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis. We found histological evidence of myocardial infarction but no sign of lymphocytic myocarditis. Histology of the small intestine showed endotheliitis (endothelialitis) of the submucosal vessels."
1118,913420,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a commonly occurring, economically significant pathogen of commercial poultry [5] . Chicks of all ages are susceptible to infection. In young chicks respiratory disease and nephritis lead to mortality, reduced weight gain and condemnation at processing, whereas in adult birds there is a reduction in egg production. Since IBV is endemic on all commercial poultry sites, flocks are vaccinated throughout production life with live and inactivated IBV vaccines. However, outbreaks of infectious bronchitis still plague the industry due to the continual emergence of variants. It is speculated that the intensive use of live, often multiple vaccines, contributes to the emergence of variants through mutations and recombination [20, 22] . For that reason attempts have been made over the last two decades to develop alternative vaccines, such as subunit vaccines [16, 33, 34, 37, 38] . Such vaccines would allow the use of only the part of the IBV protective antigen, enabling vaccination against multiple serotypes by one vaccination."

During SARS, HCWs comprised 21% of all cases and in some countries, such as Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada, more than half the cases were HCWs, with deaths reported among them [8] . HCW deaths have already been reported with A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 5 The WHO has issued guidelines for protection of HCWs which recommend contact and droplet precautions for HCWs caring for suspected COVID-19 patients [9]. Specifically, a medical mask is recommended for routine care, while a respirator (airborne precautions) is recommended if HCWs are conducting an aerosol-generating procedure such as endotracheal intubation, bronchoscopy or airway suctioning, along with droplet precautions [9] . Droplet precautions includes the recommendation to maintain spatial separation of 1 m (≈3 ft) with an infected patient, in the belief that large droplets can only spread horizontally to a maximum of 1 m (≈3 ft) [10] . The initial guidelines released by US Centers for Disease Control recommended a more precautionary approach, which includes the use of a mask by the patient (source control [11] ), and airborne precautions for HCWs [12] ."

1123,488212,"During the acute and severe threat coming from SARS-CoV-2, social distancing may be our best hope to slow the silent spread of SARS-CoV-2 since this strategy seemingly worked in China [3] . However, as measures continue to be imposed and are gradually prolonged, medium and long-term secondary damage caused through isolation must be considered in the risk assessment. Most states discuss the ongoing implementation of shielding measures for high-risk groups such as the elderly even after the end of the current regulations. In this context, we face a particular challenge, since elderly people do not only belong to the SARS-CoV-2 risk group, but also to those who suffer increased morbidity and mortality as a result of the withdrawal of social interaction and mental stimulation. It is, of course, major priority to identify and protect from immediate and acute threats -but as the COVID-19 situation progresses, additional attention should be paid to the secondary damage resulting from the measures."
1124,1285561,"The Ibis T5000 is also useful for identifying and tracking viruses. Despite higher mutation rates and greater sequence variability than bacteria, conserved primer target sites can be identified that enable priming of entire genera or even complete virus families. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a housekeeping gene that is common to all RNA viruses and provides several target-site opportunities for developing primers that amplify multiple species within a virus family. This strategy is powerful because a single PCR reaction analysed by mass spectrometry can be used to detect and identify tens to hundreds of related viral species. As shown in FIG. 4 , despite the inherent variation of base composition that is found in different flavivirus entries in Genbank, which generates a 'cloud' of base compositions for each species, each species can be distinguished. because at least two sets of primer pairs targeted to different regions of the viral genome are generally used for each virus group, potential misclassification is avoided, as two regions taken together provide unambiguous species identification. This strategy has been used effectively for broad detection and strain typing of adenoviruses 4 , influenza viruses 5 , alphaviruses 3 , coronaviruses 6 and orthopoxviruses 9 ."
1125,2039650,"A critical aspect in the interpretation of serologic tests is an understanding of the dynamic nature of the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A few studies have defined the kinetics of antibody formation in patients with disease ranging from mildly symptomatic to critically ill. These studies have consistently shown that most patients seroconvert by 2 weeks after the onset of symptoms, and almost all patients have detectable antibodies by day 28 (6, 7, 20, 64, 65) . Antibodies can be detected as early as 1 day after illness onset, with peak IgM and IgA titers occurring in the ensuing 7 to 14 days and waning thereafter. The IgG response appears to peak simultaneously in some cases, or slightly later in others (66) , and plateaus between 15 and 21 days (6). In some cases, IgG titer declines significantly within weeks (67) . Some patients appear to have weak or undetectable seroconversion (44, 66) . Illness severity probably affects antibody responses. Critically ill patients had a delayed but more robust formation of IgM and IgG in one study (7) . Anti-SARS-CoV-2 responses in subclinical infections have yet to be characterized. Finally, the suitability of alternative specimen types to serum, such as saliva or dried blood spots (68, 69), must be established for SARS-CoV-2 serodiagnostics. "
1126,2965903,"We conducted a preliminary comparison of the relative sensitivity of a cross-section of published HRV-specifi c PCR primer pairs (most of which were fi rst published before HRV-C was reported), independent of most variables described above, by testing a panel of 57 clinical specimen nucleic acid extracts from combined nose and throat swabs from preschool children with colds and infl uenza-like illnesses in Melbourne, Australia. The study was approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee. The panel included representatives of the 3 HRV species (Figure) , human enteroviruses (HEVs), and extracts negative for picornaviruses. The HRVs had been previously detected by using a nested primer pair (online Appendix Table, www.cdc.gov/EID/content/17/2/294-appT.htm) (5). We used 10 different HRV primer pairs and also retested specimens by using the original primer pair with our standard reagents and equipment (5) . We applied the published T M when possible. The original descriptions of primer pairs 7 and 10 (online Appendix Table) lacked T M information, and after in-house calculations, we used T M s of 50°C and 58°C, respectively. We also deliberately standardized the reagents (OneStep RT-PCR kit, QIA-GEN, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) and thermal cyclers used (Veriti, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for conventional PCR and the RotorGene 3000 real-time cycler (QIAGEN).

Recently, Wrapp et al. reported and shared the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of SARS-CoV-2 S trimer, which enabled additional protein engineering efforts and speeded up the process of vaccine development (42) . In addition, Lucchese searched the pentapeptides unique to SARS-CoV-2 by comparing the viral and the human proteomes and found that 107 human-foreign pentapeptides were embedded in S protein (43) . Further, these S protein pentapeptides yielded 66 candidate epitopes for vaccine development (43) . Moreover, since there were few available immunological studies related to SARS-CoV-2, Ahmed et al. screened the SARS-CoVderived epitopes due to its high level of genetic similarity with SARS-CoV-2 (44) . A screened set of SARS-CoV-derived B cell and T cell epitopes that mapped identically to SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified, which would help the initial phase of vaccine development (44) ."
1129,2876041,"A t present, prevention and supportive care dominate the approach to coronavirus disease 2019 . Treatments directly targeting the virus and the inflammatory response to it remain investigational. Convalescent plasma (CP) is one such therapy. Here we will review the results of studies on CP use for treating other viral diseases, namely severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), influenza, Ebola virus (EBOV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), followed by recent case series on its use for treating COVID-19. We will then summarize Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements for administering CP for COVID-19 and review trials being conducted in North America."
1130,2846774,"Background. The phase 3-""mitigation""-of the current pandemic by SARS-CoV-2 is now imminent also in Germany. Given the high complexity many issues have to be taken into account. Simplification is urgently warranted not to loose focus of the important things to be done. Methods. To look at phase 3 from the endpoint-in this case hospital admission-should facilitate the focus on key variables upstream. Based on a simplified model of approximated and plausible parameters for the overall attack rate (AR), the AR(hospitalization) and the AR(ICU admission), the resources needed are compared with the available resources i.e. number of beds available in general and beds in ICU in particular. The calculations are carried out population-based for Ploen County as well as regionally together with the Kiel metropolitan area. Results. Since the ARs in the up do date available cohorts are overestimated, considerably lower AR(hospitalization) and AR(ICU) should be expected. An AR(hospitalization) of 10% could not be materialized in Ploen County; one with 5% could. In the regional analysis together with the University Hospital Kiel (UKSH) an AR(hospitalization) of up to 10% is feasible, as also an AR(ICU) of 3%. The kinetics of hospital admissions is, however, dependent from countermeasures in public health as well as admission habits of the family physicians. The available number of beds is determined by beds made available and by the mean duration of hospitalization. The latter depends from the age and underlying conditions of the patients."
1131,2340380,"Our results suggest that ICU patients suffer at admission from more comorbidities and develop many complications due to hospitalization. During hospitalization they receive more aggressive treatment, and can result in a similar mortality when compared to non-ICU patients. We found that 17.6% of patients required admission to the ICU and 16.7% died. A previous study including 138 patients with COVID-19 showed that 26% of patients required admission to the ICU and 4.3% died [3] . Another study reported that 23% of patients with COVID-19 required admission to the ICU and 11.0% died [4] . It should be noted that most patients in those two studies were still hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission [3, 4] . Our hospital is one of the major tertiary teaching hospitals and is responsible for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Thus, our cohort might represent the more severe COVID-19 patients and the rates of death and ICU admission may be overestimated. A recent large-sample and multicenter study showed that only 5% of the included COVID-19 patients were admitted to ICU and 1.36% succumbed [5] ."
1132,1347122,"We were surprised to find no association between a high viral load (>10 6 copies ml -1 ) in the NPAs and RTI. This may also be due to the fact that we did not control for duration of symptoms before admission. However, an even higher viral load (>2 × 10 8 copies ml -1 ) was seen only in children with RTI. Furthermore, an association was found between a high viral load (>10 6 copies ml -1 ) and infection in the lower respiratory tract. This finding may indicate that high viral load is associated with more severe disease, and may represent a dose-effect argument for a causal relation between HBoV1 and RTI."
1133,3071055,"More than 200 Chinese medicinal herb extracts were screened for antiviral activities against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS) assay for virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). Four of these extracts showed moderate to potent antiviral activities against SARS-CoV with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) ranging from 2.4 ± 0.2 to 88.2 ± 7.7 g/ml. Out of the four, Lycoris radiata was most potent. To identify the active component, L. radiata extract was subjected to further fractionation, purification, and CPE/MTS assays. This process led to the identification of a single substance lycorine as an anti-SARS-CoV component with an EC 50 value of 15.7 ± 1.2 nM. This compound has a CC 50 value of 14980.0 ± 912.0 nM in cytotoxicity assay and a selective index (SI) greater than 900. The results suggested that four herbal extracts and the compound lycorine are candidates for the development of new anti-SARS-CoV drugs in the treatment of SARS."
1134,2275935,"Having compared hACE2 recognition by SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we further investigated hACE2 binding by bat RaTG13. To this end, we performed a pseudovirus entry assay in which retroviruses pseudotyped with RaTG13 spike (i.e., RaTG13 pseudoviruses) were used to enter hACE2-expressing human cells (Fig.3b) . The results showed that RaTG13 pseudovirus entry into cells depends on hACE2. Additionally, RaTG13 spike was not cleaved on pseudovirus surface. SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry also depends on hACE2, but its spike was cleaved to S2 on pseudovirus surface (likely because of a furin site insertion 16 ) (Fig.3b) . Moreover, we performed a protein pull-down assay using hACE2 as the bait and cell-associated RaTG13 spike as the target (Fig.3c) . The result showed that RaTG13 spike was pulled down by hACE2. Therefore, like SARS-CoV-2, bat RaTG13 binds hACE2 and can use hACE2 as its entry receptor."

1136,1964599,"In the current study, we did not find an effect of NNPDS on mortality when herd of origin and other risk factors were taken into account. The underlying aetiology of diarrhoea in the study by Gardner et al. [9] was not investigated, and discrepancies could perhaps be explained by differences in aetiology. Herd effects were not considered in the results presented by Lingaas et al. [10] , however, may have explained some of the losses attributed to diarrhoea. Overall, it is important to notice that the generally low mortality in the current study was probably partly due to study design issues. Despite these limitations, the study indicated that NNPDS was generally not associated with high mortality. This finding matched herd experiences as reported by swine practitioners [14] ."
1137,920664,"Over the last few decades, China has benefited from an unprecedented economic boom with its gross domestic product per capita growing from $193 in 1980 to $8866 in 2016. Learning hard lessons from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, the central government has been investing heavily on disease control and prevention and has devoted efforts to minimizing the damage of infectious diseases. As a result, remarkable improvements have been achieved in public health infrastructure with new laboratory facilities, upgrades of the surveillance system nationwide, and increase in the number of highly qualified public health professionals [1] . Indeed, the incidence of some infectious diseases has declined considerably. However, some other infectious diseases have rebounded or even increased in some regions. An unanswered question remains: how well the current disease prevention and management system works in response to future challenges on emerging and reemerging infectious diseases, which may be exacerbated by rapid urbanization, high numbers of population movement, such as migrant workers, ecological effects of global climate change, and policies, such as returning farmland to forests [2] ."
1138,410146,"Inflammatory pathways play essential roles in viral infections 56, 57 . As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = -1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections 58, 59 . Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on the function of multiple organs 60 . The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients' clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription 61, 62 . In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients' survival time, which may provide a chance for patients' immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Fig. 5e , melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cell-derived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus 63 ."
1139,194474,"For several members of group 2 coronaviruses (BCoV, HCoV-OC43, and HEV) 9-O-acetylated sialic acid serves as a receptor determinant (Table 2 ). These viruses also contain an HE protein (see above). Whether these viruses, in addition to binding to sialoglycoconjugates also interact with a specific protein receptor during the entry process is not known. TGEV in addition to interacting with APN also has a sialic acid binding activity and thus is an example for a coronavirus that recognizes both sialic acid and a specific protein receptor. IBV also has a sialic acid binding activity, but in addition may interact with a defined protein receptor."
1140,2618425,"What has happened in Italy during these last few weeks? On February 22nd, a ""red zone"" was defined by the government to quarantine a group of several towns in the Lombardy region, just a few hours after the diagnosis of the first case in Italy. This area, where about 50,000 persons live, included Codogno (where patient 1 was identified), Castiglione D'Adda, and Casalpusterlengo. On March 8th, the red zone was extended to the entire region of Lombardy (about 10 million people) and several surrounding provinces in a new attempt of preventing the uncontrolled diffusion of the virus to the rest of the country. The following day, the entire country was transformed into a ""red zone"". On March 21st, a complete lockdown of Italy was ordered by the government as a drastic and unprecedented countermeasure against the coronavirus."
1141,1195574,"The Ibis T5000 technology was initially developed for broad bacterial and viral detection and identification; however, PCR/ ESI-MS is also a very powerful tool for high-resolution molecular genotyping of microbes. Applications of the technology can be thought of in an hourglass model as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The upper portion of the hourglass depicts identification of microbes, generally bacteria and viruses, present in an unknown sample at the species level as described. The utility of PCR/ESI-MS has been demonstrated for broad bacterial surveillance (2) and for identification of virus families, including coronaviruses (4) , influenza viruses (5) , adenoviruses (6) , alphaviruses (7) , and orthopoxviruses (3) . The bottom portion of the hourglass in Fig. 1 refers to assays developed on the PCR/ESI-MS platform that are specific for a particular species; these assays reveal molecular details such as the presence of virulence factors, antibiotic or antiviral drug resistance, or high-resolution molecular signatures that distinguish closely related subspecies. These high-resolution molecular analyses require separate assays that investigate important questions unique to a particular microbe. For example, for Staphylococcus aureus , it is important to determine the presence 2. High-Resolution Molecular Genotyping by Multilocus PCR and Mass Spectrometry or absence of certain virulence factors, mobile genetic elements, or mutations in housekeeping genes that mediate drug resistance. For understanding the genetic lineage of microbes, the PCR/ ESI-MS method follows the general principles of multilocus sequence typing (MLST)."
1142,2120980,"Recent publications have described associations between RSV loads and severity scores [40, 41] , duration of hospitalization [30, 31] , and Intensive Care Unit requirements [30] . Moreover, analyzes considering the days of symptoms prior to sample collection have shown that viral clearance is an important factor to consider [30, 41] , since significant differences are detected in genomic loads and their predictive capacity of severity depending on the date of sampling. In our study, we confirmed that a greater number of RSV genomic copies are found when sampling occurs early during the LRTI, being significantly lower when the samples are collected later than 3 days of onset of cough, the symptom we chose as a marker of LRTI. In agreement with the studies by Zhou et al. [41] and El Saleeby et al. [30] , we found higher viral loads in the infants with severe LRTI with more than 3 days of lower respiratory tract symptoms, but not in infants with severe LRTI at 3 days or less of illness, suggesting a difference in the kinetics of viral clearance. We postulate that a delayed viral clearance is contributing to greater airway injury and longer duration of severe LRTI. Although the main limitation in this study is the lack of sequential samples from our patients, we believe that the data reported complements the limited information collected by other authors. We propose a simple clinical approach with cough as a marker to characterize a population that may benefit from possible future therapeutic approaches. The data presented in relation to genotypes and viral loads should drive further exploration of viral evolution and viral dynamics during primary RSV infection and its relation to severity."
1143,906765,"A clade of picornaviruses recently discovered in New York State is globally distributed and is found in association with community outbreaks of ARI and severe LRTIs of infants. These viruses contribute both to a substantial proportion of previously undiagnosed respiratory illness and to diagnosed, but nontyped cases of HRV infection. Similar viruses were recently characterized also in Queensland, Australia (11); California, USA (12); Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China (13) ; and Germany (16) . Our fi ndings indicate the need for further investigation into this third (HRV-C) group of rhinoviruses with emphasis on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and strategies to prevent and ameliorate disease caused by HRV infection."
1144,3138506,"A pneumonia outbreak with unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in December 2019, associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The causative agent of the outbreak was identified by the WHO as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), producing the disease named coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The virus is closely related (96.3%) to bat coronavirus RaTG13, based on phylogenetic analysis. Human-to-human transmission has been confirmed even from asymptomatic carriers. The virus has spread to at least 200 countries, and more than 1,700,000 confirmed cases and 111,600 deaths have been recorded, with massive global increases in the number of cases daily. Therefore, the WHO has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The disease is characterized by fever, dry cough, and chest pain with pneumonia in severe cases. In the beginning, the world public health authorities tried to eradicate the disease in China through quarantine but are now transitioning to prevention strategies worldwide to delay its spread. To date, there are no available vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs to treat the virus. There are many knowledge gaps about the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, leading to misinformation. Therefore, in this review, we provide recent information about the COVID-19 pandemic. This review also provides insights for the control of pathogenic infections in humans such as SARS-CoV-2 infection and future spillovers."
1145,2770029,"A new highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza, H5N1, emerged in the poultry markets of Hong Kong in 1997 and subsequently re-emerged in Vietnam in 2003. From this time onwards it has rapidly spread across the globe and is likely to be endemic in poultry in many parts of the world. Although onward transmission to humans at present remains limited, the high case fatality rate in those people that are infected has raised concerns about the impact of a potential human pandemic [1, 2] . Whilst much research and planning is currently underway to contain any outbreak in humans, relatively little is known about the extent of infection in poultry and, in particular, the transmissibility of highly pathogenic avian influenzas between poultry farms. Such understanding is vital if we are to limit the potential for a human pandemic by reducing the extent of infection in poultry, either through movement restrictions, culling or vaccination."

1147,2430256,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly infectious and contagious pathogen of chickens worldwide. The genome of IBV, a member of the family Coronaviridae , contains a single-stranded, positivesense RNA of 27.6 kb (Boursnell et al., 1987) . The virion is an enveloped pleomorphic particle approximately 80 to 100 nm in diameter and has three major virus-encoded structural proteins, which include the spike (S) glycoprotein, the membrane (M) protein, and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The spikes of IBV are formed by post-translational cleavage of two separate polypeptide components designated S1 and S2 (Cavanagh, 1983a,b) . The molecular identification of IBV is based mainly on analysis of the S1 protein gene (Lin et al., 1991; Handberg et al., 1999; Kingsham et al., 2000; de Wit, 2000; Cavanagh, 2001a,b; Li & Yang, 2001) .

1148,2350142,"inspired bioaerosol mobility by influencing aerosol generation within the fluid lining of the lungs has been explored [17, 18] . The deposition of appropriate quantities of inhaled saline solutions in the lungs appears to alter the physical properties of lung lining fluid, possibly by modulating ionic interactions between charged mucins. This results in the creation of fewer and more-inert droplets, which consequently travel shorter distances through the air in the lungs and the immediate environment. Although the chemical and physical properties involved in bioaerosol generation within the lungs and the factors influencing airborne disease spread must be better Respiration of airborne pathogens. Airborne pathogens generated from the lungs of an infected individual have three potential outcomes: pathogen aspiration can occur by deep inhalation of the airborne agents, potentially leading to more-severe infection in the infected individual; large droplets that travel short distances from the infected individuals (<10 µm) might be expelled, landing on clothing and/or surfaces, thus providing a well of contact-related infectious agents (fomites); or droplet nuclei (0.1-5.0 µm) are emitted that carry pathogens and can stay airborne for extended periods of time, traveling great distances.These droplet nuclei can subsequently be inhaled by an uninfected recipient, resulting in secondary infection.The inset shows that bioaerosol droplets and droplet nuclei are generated by the passage of airflow over the airway lining fluid.This airflow results in shear of the liquid surface, creating surface disturbances that lead to droplet creation.

1150,1964421,"Postmortem inspection of the intestines of gnotobiotic calves after experimental infection with BRV exhibited few macroscopic changes, except for the thinness of the intestinal wall; on histological examination, changes typical of acute viral infection were noted. Villous fusion and atrophy (Fig. 6) and epithelial desquamation were seen, from the midjejunum to the lower small intestine, in addition to areas of necrosis in the large intestine. Both crypt and villus epithelial cells were infected (Woode et al., 1982; Woode, 1987) . The watery diarrhea is probably a result of loss of resorptive capacity of the colonic mucosa, combined with mild malabsorption in the small intestine (Hall, 1987) . Infection of crypt epithelium may affect the duration of diarrhea, as regeneration of villus epithelium starts in the crypts. The germinal centers of the Peyer's patches were depleted of lymphocytes and occasionally showed fresh hemorrhage (Woode et al., 1982) . The dome epithelial cells, including the M cells, had the same cytopathic changes that occurred in the absorptive cells of villi Pohlenz et al., 1984) . In tissues underlying the intestinal epithelium (lamina propria), the major pathological changes were edema and the presence of activated macrophages (Fagerland et al., 1986) . One of the BRVinfected calves had multifocal petechial hemorrhages and vesicular emphysema in the lungs (Woode et al., 1982) . EM examination of affected areas revealed the presence of virions in cells of both the small and large intestines. Extracellular virus appeared in close association with microvilli of absorptive cells and in coated pits between microvilli, which was interpreted to indicate receptor-mediated endocytosis (Fagerland et al., 1986; Goldstein et al., 1979) . In addition, virions were found between enterocytes at the basal and lateral plasma membranes. Virions in various stages of degradation were present in macrophages within the lamina propria (Fagerland et al., 1986; ."
1151,252726,"The minimal cellular cap structure, named ""cap0"", consists of a N7-methylated guanosine (m 7 G) linked to the 5 0 end of the mRNA by a 5 0 triphosphate bond. This structure controls mRNA export, maturation, stability, and translation. The first and second nucleotides of cellular mRNAs are further methylated at the 2 0 -O positions, leading to the formation of ""cap1"" and ""cap2"". Several antiviral sensors interact with the 5 0 end of vRNAs, which usually bear unusual cap structures (Decroly et al., 2011) or triphosphate ends, in contrast to uncapped host RNAs that have 5 0 monophosphate ends. Incubation of cellular extracts with immobilized RNA probes harboring 5 0 triphosphate ends coupled to proteomics led to the identification of a family of proteins with high affinity for this unusual molecular pattern, called IFIT1-5 or interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (Pichlmair et al., 2011) . The expression of these proteins is triggered rapidly after activation of the host antiviral defenses. IFIT proteins target nonself, single-stranded (ss)RNAs in a 5 0 -end-dependent manner (sensing 5 0 triphosphate and cap0 RNAs) to inhibit infection by different mechanisms, mainly by affecting viral translation (Habjan et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014) . The unconventional RNA-binding activity of IFIT1, 2, and 5 has been recently unraveled and resides in the TPRs, which usually mediate protein-protein interactions. These repeats generate an α-helix-rich fold with a positively charged, small pocket that, together with the participation of acidic residues that coordinate divalent cations, embraces the negatively charged triphosphate ends (Abbas, Pichlmair, Gorna, Superti-Furga, & Nagar, 2013) . The different proteins of the IFIT family appear to have developed different roles and modes of action. Both IFIT1 and IFIT5 interact only with ssRNA. IFIT5 binds RNA with cap0, 5 0 monophosphate, or 5 0 triphosphate ends with similar affinities and do not interact with cap1 (Katibah et al., 2014) . IFIT1 forms part of a multiprotein complex together with IFIT2 and IFIT3 (Pichlmair et al., 2011) and can bind cap0 with very high affinity in addition to 5 0 triphosphate RNAs (with lower affinity than IFIT5) (Kumar et al., 2014) . Functionally, IFIT1 can outcompete the binding of EIF4F complex to the cap0, thus inhibiting viral translation initiation, while IFIT5 can inhibit 48S translation initiation complex formation on mRNAs with 5 0 triphosphate ends (Fleith et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2014) . IFIT1 and IFIT2 can also block viral protein synthesis by interacting with the EIF3 complex (Diamond & Farzan, 2013; Vladimer et al., 2014) , which has a central role in translation initiation of cellular and viral transcripts (Cate, 2017) . IFIT3 has no known RNA-binding capacity, but it has been recently described to allosterically modulate the IFIT1 RNA-binding pocket thus enhancing its affinity for cap0 (Fleith et al., 2018; Johnson et al., 2018) . IFIT2 is an RBP that can selectively bind AU-rich RNAs and might recognize specific sequences in vRNAs (Yang et al., 2012) . Some viruses such as flavivirus, poxvirus, and coronavirus can escape from IFIT1 and IFIT2 by methylating their vRNA 5 0 cap (Daffis et al., 2010) . Other vRNAs lack a 2 0 -O methylated cap but can still evade IFIT1 restriction. For example, a stable stem-loop structure located in the 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) of the genomic RNA of alphaviruses antagonizes IFIT1 antiviral activity (Hyde et al., 2014) ."

1154,2026460,"The impact on the psychological well-being of the trainees during the pandemic has also been identified with many helpful resources outlined in the literature. 3, 4, 9, 19 In our questionnaire, the overall stress level associated with exposure to COVID-19 was low. This is likely due to the strategies utilized by the programs in minimizing time at work and allowing physical distancing, as well as the fact that radiology is primarily a nonpatient-facing specialty. 20 The programs employed a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, many of which have been outlined in the recent literature. 3, 4, [8] [9] [10] As expected, the most widely utilized approach was the adoption of virtual modalities for providing teaching rounds and case reviews. Many residency programs around the world resorted to virtual modalities for delivering educational programming to their trainees. Additionally, a large number of respondents' programs ensured physical distancing by modifying daytime and after-hour schedules. This is in line with the strategy outlined by Chong et al 4 where at some of the California-based programs, 2 separate teams were created in terms of onsite and off-site duties. Many respondents also reported additional educational resources offered by their programs. This is in keeping with the overall spirit of the radiology community in openly embracing the challenges of the pandemic and providing numerous virtual educational opportunities to trainees."

1157,1978182,"Although falls and delirium are considered atypical presentations of COVID-19, 5 these events are common in older adults with multiple comorbidities. 10 During the previous SARS epidemic, which originated in China in 2003, 11 the WHO also developed guidelines for possible cases that included fever as a prerequisite for the case definition of a ""possible case of SARS."" 11 However, several reports described cases of confirmed SARS-CoV infection in older adults who had initially presented without fever. 12 At that time, SARS testing was similarly delayed in afebrile patients who presented with nonspecific symptoms. 12 Unfortunately, the initial failure to diagnose SARS infection in those patients led to a devastating outbreak. 11, 12 It is possible that older adults may not exhibit the typical inflammatory febrile response due to changes in thermoregulation and immune cell dysregulation. 13 Agerelated changes in the immune system render the body more susceptible to infections, and older adults may exhibit dysregulated immune cell responses to infections. 14 Therefore, clinicians should be mindful of the possibility of an atypical or late-stage presentation of serious infections in older patients. 10 The balance between resource management and public safety remains very delicate in the context of a rapidly growing pandemic. 15 Particularly in this scenario, limited medical resources force policymakers to allocate resources based on a careful consideration of competing ethical values. 15 In this case, we were fortunate to have a dynamic and instantly responsive command administration and infection control task force. These teams orchestrated a coordinated case management effort that undeniably prevented a costly outbreak in our community."
1158,1565245,"Although detection of the RNA by either PCR or sequencing is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, false negative results of the nucleotide assay have been reported due to problems related to sample collection and/or detection methods. In this study, both the ELISA and the chemiluminescence methods exhibited good consistency with nucleic acid detection. For the ELISA, rN-based IgG was seemingly more sensitive than rS-based IgG for discriminating between the patients and the controls. The differential sensitivity of the rS-based and rN-based IgG ELISA that was demonstrated in the present report may have originated from different restricted IgG-dominated antibody responses (Leung et al., 2004) . In contrast, both rN-based IgM and rS-based IgM were able to discriminate the positive patients from the controls, so it may be a good tool to use with the nucleic acid test. If a patient has a high A 450 value for IgM but has anegative nucleic acid test result, they should be followed and re-tested for the virus by PCR. False-negative results from PCR may be misleading. The rS-based IgM ELISA was reported to be more sensitive than the rN-based IgM ELISA because the S1 protein is a transmembrane protein, which may easily stimulate the body to produce the IgM antibody, especially during early infection (Woo et al., 2005) . The limitation of serum IgM and IgG for COVID-19 diagnosis may be that the time span after disease onset could affect the A value, which may reduce the sensitivities of the assays. If blood samples were collected druing the early stage of the infection, they may produce false negative results. Other molecules including interferon, rheumatoid factor, non-specific IgM and so on, might cause false positive. Moreover, since the identity of the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Co reached up to 91.2%, there is probably to a crossreaction between the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 and antibodies against other human coronaviruses. It is better to verify the detection results with the combination of assay against both the N protein and S proteins."

The recent outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 emphasizes the importance of analyzing the epidemiological data of this novel virus and predicting their risks of infecting people all around the globe. In this study, we present an effort to compile and analyze epidemiological outbreak information on COVID-19 based on the several open datasets on 2019-nCoV provided by the Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission, and DXY.

1178,217265,"The finding that urea removed Sl but not S2 from IBV led to the proposal that S2 anchored S in the viral membrane (Cavanagh, 1983~) . This conclusion has been strengthened by nucleotide sequence analysis of the spike precursor gene of IBV-Beaudette (Binns et al.. 1985) which is of the same serotype as IBV-M41. The 71 C-terminal residues (M, 7.7K) comprise a hydrophilic tail (27 residues) followed by a 44 residue stretch with a very hydrophobic character. This arrangement is typical of the membrane-anchoring sequences of the spike proteins of several other viruses. The M, of S2 minus the C-terminal 71 residues is approximately 76.3K. Trypsin hydrolyzed S2 of IBV-M41 to a glycopolypeptide of 76.1K, especially in the presence of saponin. Inspection of the IBV-Beaudette sequence shows that the first target residues for trypsin (arginyl and lysyl) after the 44 residue highly hydrophobic sequence are at positions 72. 76 and 81 from the C-terminus (Binns et al., 1985) . Cleavage at one or more of these residues would result in the generation of a peptide of 71-80 residues of M, about 8-9K and a large glycopolypeptide of about 75-76K. Since trypsin did generate .such a glycopolypeptide. especially with saponin present, and since these basic residues are conserved in IBV-M41 (M.M. Binns. pers. comm.), this suggests that S2 was cleaved in the region of 71-80 residues from the C-terminus and that this region is close to but possibly not completely exposed at the outer membrane surface. The presence of a protease sensitive site near the point of membrane insertion is a feature of the HA2 glycopolypeptide of the influenza virus haemagglutinin (Brand and Skehel. 1972) . The HA, of A/Hong Kong/l968 influenza virus is cleaved by bromelain at a position which is 10 residues away from the uncharged anchoring domain (Wilson et al., 1981) . The sites at which hydrolysis generates the 71K glycopolypeptides may be only a few residues upstream from the proposed trypsin cleavage site. S2 has a potential glycosylation site 88 residues from the C-terminus."
1179,475295,"In this series, respiratory viral infections occured within the first postnatal month. None of the neonates with proven respiratory viral infections were febrile. The symptoms of influenza or common respiratory viral infection in the neonate may be trivial and nonspecific, making prompt diagnosis difficult. This could create problems with triage at the emergency department. To our knowledge, these were among the youngest neonates with influenza A and respiratory viral infections reported in Hong Kong. The local policy is that an unwell neonate (with or without fever) will be admitted to the neonatal service in an incubator at a designated area pending nasopharyngeal swab for respiratory virus or other investigations if symptoms are non-respiratory or non-specific. The baby will be admitted to a neonatal intensive care service with negative-pressure isolation facility if he/she is critically ill. The patient will be admitted to the pediatric ICU instead if he/she is older than 28 days of age. Other option includes admission to a pediatric infection ward for respiratory viral infection if the child is less ill. Nevertheless, isolation facilities may be overwhelmed during an influenza epidemic. As H1N1 is not airborne, it is appropriate to monitor a neonate with suspected pandemic H1N1-09 in an incubator in designated cubicle pending rapid viral investigation. Interestingly, the pandemic H1N1-09 does not appear to be the prevalent respiratory virus in the neonates."

1181,5,"From the very first events of the MERS-CoV epidemic, the virus showed its health careeassociated dynamic. 6 Apart of sporadic community cases and family clusters, health careeassociated transmission has been reported on several occasions during the last 2 years, indicating human-to-human, although inconsistent, transmission (Table 1) . 2, 3, 6, 8, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] Gaps in infection control were the common denominator in the events of health care associatede transmission. 2, 3, 6, 8, 22, 24 During the largest so farepublished outbreak of MERS-CoV that occurred in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013, 4 health care facilities were affected through transfer of patients but also possibly because of repeated introductions of cases from the community. 3 The outbreak extended for almost 2 months and involved 34 cases, including 2 HCWs. Most cases were confined in the hemodialysis unit with rapid transmission and high attack rates. 3 This outbreak gave the opportunity to elucidate several epidemiologic parameters of secondary MERS-CoV infection, such as the incubation period (5.2 days; 95% confidence interval, 1.92-14.7 days), serial interval (7.6 days; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-23.1 days), and heterogeneity in transmission, with many infected patients not transmitting the infection at all and 1 infected patient transmitting the infection to 7 others. 3 Moreover, this outbreak raised the possibility of transmission through direct or indirect contact and between rooms in the same ward. 3 A recent study showed that MERS-CoV remained viable for up to 48 hours under specific environmental conditions, which mimic the hospital environment (20 C with 40% relative humidity), whereas its stability was not reduced during aerosolization. 28 These data show that MERS-CoV has the potential to spread through contact or fomites caused by prolonged survival. A model-based study found that the virus structural characteristics render it very likely to remain viable in the environment for a long period and support fecal-oral transmission. 29 Vomiting and diarrhea are common in patients with MERS-CoV 1,22,27 and may contribute to transmission. The MERS-CoV case imported in France shared his bathroom with the secondary hospital-acquired case, which raises the possibility of spread through stools. 22 MERS-CoV is predominantly shed through respiratory secretions during cough. MERS-CoV has been detected through polymerase chain reaction for up to 16 days in respiratory specimens and stools and up to 13 days in urine. 22, 30, 31 Our knowledge about virus shedding and viral load kinetics throughout the clinical course of ill patients is scarce and therefore can provide limited guidance about the duration of implementation of infection control measures. 31 The possibility of prolonged shedding under an immunocompromised status should also be investigated and considered for infection control purposes."

1186,2356151,"Household transmission studies of children and adults reveal that being female (female relative risk [RR]: 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-2.73) is a significant factor associated with higher secondary attack rates of influenza-like illness, with attack rates being higher among children and young adults than older adults (>55 years of age) [11] . Reported male-female differences in the incidence of infection vary with age in several countries, with a higher incidence of infection with 2009 H1N1 in young women than young men of comparable age [12] [13] [14] [15] .

Moreover, whether human cells encode 4-O-acetyltransferase is elusive [25, 26] . 9-O-acetylated (as well as 4-and 7-O-) and non-modified Neu5Ac naturally occur as part of host cell developmental and/or homeostasis processes, among others [21] . Some viral pathogens including influenza virus C and coronaviruses that use that modified glycan receptor for their entry into host cells have evolved to exploit such chemical modifications of Neu5Ac for their core life cycles [26] [27] [28] . However, thus far, whether bacterial toxins or virulence factors can use similar tactics for their pathogenesis is unknown. Here we investigated specifically on the role of 9-O-acetyl modification (the most abundant O-acetylated form of sialic acids in humans) of the glycan receptor moieties in the binding and intoxication for Salmonella typhoid toxin."
1188,276399,"Specific CTL activity has been demonstrated as an important factor to control viral infections. Previously many studies to access the CTL activity were performed in in vitro system, which may not directly reflect the situation in vivo. To detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-specific CTL in vivo, we have adopted the method previously documented [19, 20] . After the target splenocytes differential labeled with CSFE were transferred into immunized or control mouse intravenously, specific antigen-labeled target cells were killed while the antigen unlabeled target would have survived. Fig. 4 shows that the degree of specific lysis is achieved in target cells isolated from the lymph node 4 h after the transfer into the immunized syngeneic host. The specific lysis of target cells at 50.6% (Fig. 4E) was observed in the mice immunized with the pcD3d/N construct, at 17% with those injected with the pcD3d/M construct (Fig. 4D) , and at 5.6% with the group injected with the pcD3d/E construct (Fig. 4C) . These data suggest that the mice vaccinated with the N construct produce the highest of CTL activities in vivo, which can be further concluded from the previous results that the N gene contains the more immunogenetic regions for T and B cell stimulations."
1189,856799,"To date, the most potent neutralizing antibodies against flaviviruses are mapped to domain III of the E protein [8, [57] [58] [59] . Antibodies mapped to DIII are typically virus or serotype-specific and less cross reactive, perhaps due to the lowest sequence identity between different flaviviruses among the three domains of the E protein [58] . Several important epitopes in DIII have been identified through panning of memory B cells collected from either flavivirus-infected patients or challenged mice. These epitopes include the lateral ridge [57, 60, 61] , C-C loop [61, 62] and A strand [59, 63] in DIII."
1190,808609,"In fact, most early cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been described in the elderly and arose after close contact in hospital and family settings 42, 89 . Emergence of virulence in the SARS-CoV background in older hosts could require fewer mutations and less passage than is required in young hosts 57 . Moreover, if close proximity is an important determinant for efficient coronavirus cross-species transmission and dissemination, it is possible that the current and projected ecological and demographic conditions are approaching a critical point. The Coronaviridae family is poised to excel in these conditions and colonize this growing niche. If these hypotheses are correct, accelerated transmission of bat and animal coronaviruses to humans can be expected to continue and possibly escalate. Public health authorities should prepare by developing broadly applicable platform strategies for the rapid diagnosis, containment and treatment of, and vaccination against, emerging coronavirus infections. We have been warned twice in recent years, and the belief that coronaviruses are highly vulnerable to public health intervention strategies is not supported by the increasing incidence of coronavirus emergence in livestock animal populations and the identification of novel coronaviruses in reservoir species, despite the application of widespread disease management practices and intervention strategies."
1191,3125729,"Critical care has evolved from treatment of poliomyelitis victims with respiratory failure in an intensive care unit to treatment of severely ill patients irrespective of location or specifi c technology. Population-based studies in the developed world suggest that the burden of critical illness is higher than generally appreciated and will increase as the population ages. Critical care capacity has long been needed in the developing world, and eff orts to improve the care of the critically ill in these settings are starting to occur. Expansion of critical care to handle the consequences of an ageing population, natural disasters, confl ict, inadequate primary care, and higher-risk medical therapies will be challenged by high costs at a time of economic constraint. To meet this challenge, investigators in this discipline will need to measure the global burden of critical illness and available critical-care resources, and develop both preventive and therapeutic interventions that are generalisable across countries."

1194,2089376,"The route to certainty on the degree and nature of the immunity required for protection will require evidence from formal proofs using approaches such as titrated transfers of antibodies and T lymphocytes to define protection in non-human primate models, as used, for example, in studies of Ebola virus. 9 A study of survivors of SARS showed that about 90% had functional, virus-neutralising antibodies and around 50% had strong T-lymphocyte responses. 10 These observations bolster confidence in a simple view that most survivors of severe COVID-19 would be expected to have protective antibodies. A caveat is that most studies, either of SARS survivors or of COVID-19 patients, have focused on people who were hospitalised and had severe, symptomatic disease. Similar data are urgently needed for individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection who have not been hospitalised."
1195,307437,"There are a number of different species of Babesia worldwide. They are protozoan parasites of the class Piroplasmea (or Sporozoea), order Piroplasmida, or more loosely, piroplasms. The agents resemble malaria parasites and babesiosis may be mistakenly diagnosed as malaria. In the United States, B microti is the most commonly identified agent, although B divergens is also present. At least two other unnamed species have been identified in Washington and California and are respectively known as WA-1 and CA-1. 2 Babesia spp. infect numerous mammalian species and are transmitted by ticks, primarily the Ixodes genus. B microti is transmitted by Ixodes dammini (also known as I scapularis), the black-legged or deer tick. The primary mammalian reservoir is the white-footed mouse, but the tick may also be transported by deer. B microti has a restricted, but expanding geographic range in the United States; it is largely confined to Northeastern coastal areas and parts of the upper Midwest, including Minnesota and Wisconsin. B divergens also has been identified in some US states, but the tick vector has not been identified. The human is always an accidental host, acquiring infection through a tick-bite, which frequently goes unnoticed, as Ixodes ticks are very small. Ticks have to attach to their host for 1 to 3 days in order to effectively transmit the parasite."

1202,1676731,"The development of DNA vaccines has evolved since the initial description of the ability of naked DNA to support gene expression after intramuscular injection. 3, 4 The concept behind these vaccines is that expression of specifi c viral genes under the control of eukaryotic enhancer-promoters and polyadenylation signals allows appropriate expression of specifi c viral gene products which can be processed and presented as foreign antigens. The genes encoded by DNA vaccines can be readily modifi ed and regulatory sequences can be adjusted to optimize level, duration and potency of the immunogen. 5 When injected into muscle, DNA is taken up by cells surrounding the injection site and internalized. After uptake and transport to the nucleus, transcription, translation, and post-translational modifi cation allow for the synthesis of a specifi ed gene product. In contrast to inactivated virus particles or recombinant protein vaccines produced in bacteria, yeast or mammalian cells, proteins expressed from gene-based DNA vaccines are more likely to assume a native conformation, and their expression within cells allows for more native processing and presentation of antigens that can stimulate CD4 and CD8 responses in vivo. Because they are in native form, the antibodies generated against these immunogens are theoretically more likely to be cross-reactive with native viral gene products from the pathogen. In addition, because DNA is rapidly degraded in the body, the plasmid DNA vaccines can provide an advantage in terms of safety, in contrast to live-attenuated viruses, with the possibility of chronic infection and immune stimulation."
1203,1969102,"The incidence of disease epidemics in wildlife, and pathogens spilling over from wildlife into humans, is increasing in countries where urbanization has recently or is currently occurring Hassell et al. 2017) . Human urbanization extends city boundaries and alters wildlife host community compositions, leading to biodiversity shifts and loss (Keesing et al. 2010) , disturbing the delicate balance between microbes and their natural wild animal reservoir hosts. Human urbanization also brings domesticated animals into closer contact with wild animals, providing opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, as evidenced by recent outbreaks of canine distemper virus in giant pandas in China (Feng et al. 2015; Jin et al. 2017 ) and the introduction of feline leukemia virus in the Florida puma in the USA (Cunningham et al. 2008) . Changes in wildlife populations due to infectious disease outbreaks can have long-term serious consequences for ecosystem resilience. Disease outbreaks in wildlife may also result in direct infection of nearby human populations or changes in wildlife host population dynamics, leading to spillover of other pathogens to humans or domestic livestock (Daszak et al. 2000) . A prime example is the recent emergence of a novel coronavirus, SADS-CoV, from bats to pigs, resulting from pig farms encroaching on bat habitat, devastating several pig farms in Southern China and posing a major biosecurity risk to the USA (Luo et al. 2018) ."
1204,2776780,"In community-acquired pneumonia, previous studies have reported the clinical interaction between influenza and S. pneumoniae or S. aureus as a major contributor to influenza mortality [2, [16] [17] [18] [19] . It is becoming clear that similar interactions may occur with other RVs, including RSV, human metapneumovirus, and possibly rhinovirus or parainfluenza virus [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, clinical evidence from prospective studies on the role of coinfection in severity is somewhat conflicting [2, 14, 25, 26] . In our study it should be underlined that all eight HAP cases with long-term shedding of community-acquired viruses involved immunocompromised patients with coinfection with other pathogens. Shedding of rhinoviruses for more than 4 weeks is not uncommon even in immunocompetent individuals [27] and especially in patients with immunodeficiency in whom chronic rhinovirus carriage for as long as 4-12 months has been documented [28] . The significance of rhinovirus detection in respiratory specimens from pneumonia patients is a subject of some debate. Some findings have demonstrated that rhinovirus infection alters the respiratory microbiome and may precipitate secondary bacterial infections in patients with COPD [29, 30] ."
1205,1751194,"The innate immune response is the first line of defense against infection [51] . PRRSV infection of cells clearly up-regulated IFN-β and, to a lesser extent, IFN-α, confirming previous published data [52, 53] . Interestingly, S. suis also up-regulated IFN-β and, to a lesser extent, IFN-α. Although the up-regulation of type I IFN genes has previously been reported in vitro with swine epithelial cells [54] and in vivo in a mouse model of infection [16] , this is the first report of a clear up-regulation of such genes by porcine DCs infected with S. suis. Type I IFNs are now known to play important roles in infections caused by extracellular bacteria, including streptococci [55] . Although the co-infection did not potentiate the expression of type I IFNs compared to cells infected with PRRSV alone, the elevated production of these cytokines by PRRSV could have an incidence on the bacterial infection. IFN-β has been shown to potentiate the septic shock syndrome or to induce the inhibition of the myeloid cell response to IFN-γ, an important cytokine for bacterial clearance [56, 57] . However, this hypothesis remains to be confirmed."
1206,925883,"In late December, 2019, the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (named SARS-CoV-2) started in Wuhan, China, which has quickly spread to many countries in the world 1 . Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 have been shown to vary widely, from asymptomatic clinical presentation to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [2] [3] [4] . It remains unknown what host factors may affect the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Our recent studies indicated that monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) overwhelmed in the severely damaged lungs, while the formation of tissue resident with highly expanded clonal CD8+ T cells in mildly symptomatic patients suggested a robust adaptive immune response associated with better control of COVID-19 5 . Moreover, a higher titer of antibody in the plasma was independently associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19 6 . These data suggest that the host immune status, to some extent, may affect the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is lack of direct evidence for immune influence on the acute infection of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we report a unique case of COVID-19 with preexisting immune dysfunction from previous coinfection of HIV and HCV, who showed persistently negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test but delayed antibody response in the plasma.

The etiological agent is a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, named for the similarity of its symptoms to those induced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome. As of February 28, 2020, 78,959 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been confirmed in China, with 2,791 deaths. Worryingly, there have also been more than 3,664 confirmed cases outside of China in 46 countries and areas (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), raising significant doubts about the likelihood of successful containment.

1210,1596513,"There are several roles of radiologists in this outbreak. First, early detection of the radiological abnormality can provide a suspicion of pneumonia in patients at risk. Although, the definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, radiological findings are important for the diagnosis of pneumonia. Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia would enable rapid management planning including further imaging follow-ups and conservative care. Given the fact that the most frequent imaging finding is GGO, careful interpretation of the chest radiographs is needed as GGOs may look very faint. CT scans are recommended in patients with suspicious lung abnormality. Second, disease severity can be suggested and notified to the clinicians. Michael et al. [9] reported that one COVID-19-infected patient with the highest severity score (lung involvement score) on the CT scan was admitted to the intensive care unit. In addition, a high rate (19.6%) of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was observed from the patients with COVID-19 pneumonia [5] . Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of ARDS. Third, radiologists can give a suspicion of bacterial secondary infection. Notably, bacterial co-infection was common (12%-19%) among hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza and confirmed pneumonia [14] . Bacterial co-infection was associated with serious outcomes [14] . Therefore, it is our role to provide an impression of secondary infection, which would necessitate antibiotic treatment. Fourth, radiologists should make an effort to educate trainees and clinicians of the imaging findings of emerging infectious diseases including COVID-19. This is the third outbreak caused by the coronavirus in the recent decades. Radiologists and clinicians should be prepared for unexpected infectious diseases to fight epidemic and potential pandemic."
1211,180891,"At the time of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated coronavirus epidemic [6] in 2003, several molecules were tested to assess their effectiveness against this virus. Among these, teicoplanin [7] , an antistaphylococcal agent, had proven efficacy in vitro , and this was also the case for chloroquine, at a 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of approximatively 8 μM, and when added to the cell culture either before of after exposure to the virus [5 , 8-10] . These findings ended up being forgotten because of the disappearance of SARS for reasons that are neither clear nor explained [11] . The novel coronavirus currently isolated in China has been, with staggering speed, evaluated regarding its sensitivity to already used drugs [12] . Thus, the new antiviral drug remdesivir [13] as well as chloroquine, at an EC 50 of 1.1 μM, were found to be effective in preventing replication of this virus [12] . Chloroquine is perhaps one of the most prescribed drugs in the world [14 , 15] . As a matter of fact, all Europeans visiting malaria-endemic geographic areas for decades received chloroquine prophylaxis and continued it for 2 months after their return. In addition, local residents took chloroquine continuously, and treatment of malaria has long been based on this drug. In addition, hydroxychloroquine has been used for decades at much higher doses (up to 600 mg/day) to treat autoimmune diseases [16] . It is difficult to find a product that currently has a better established safety profile than chloroquine. Furthermore, its cost is negligible. Hence, its possible use both in prophylaxis in people exposed to the novel coronavirus and as a curative treatment will probably be promptly evaluated by our Chinese colleagues. If clinical data confirm the biological results, the novel coronavirus-associated disease will have become one of the simplest and cheapest to treat and prevent among infectious respiratory diseases.

1213,276741,"Virtually all genetic cases of HLH and many secondary cases should be treated with HSCT. The first report of successful HSCT was reported in 1986. 252 Several studies have demonstrated that HSCT is the only true hope for permanent control of the disease or essentially a cure. [253] [254] [255] [256] [257] A study of 86 children treated with HLH-94 followed by HSCT demonstrated similar long-term disease-free survival (70% at 3 years) with matched unrelated donor transplants as with matched sibling transplants. Survival with family haploidentical donor transplants or mismatched unrelated transplants showed much less favorable results with long-term disease-free survival of only 50%. 258 Cord blood transplant has been successful in some patients. However, overall transplant morbidity and mortality remains high. The same pediatric study showed a mortality rate of 26 out of 86 patients, with deaths resulting from pulmonary and liver complications. 258 Patients responding well to pretransplant induction therapy appear to respond best to HSCT. Pre-transplant conditioning regimens generally include busulfan, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide. Busulfan levels must be carefully monitored, and clonazepam or phenytoin may be useful as anticonvulsive prophylaxis. Dexamethasone may be used to prevent VP-16-induced anaphylactic-like symptoms. Mesna can be used for protection against cyclophosphamideinduced bladder injury. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may be used for pneumocystis prophylaxis, and acyclovir prophylaxis is recommended. 7 Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) appears to be the most common complication post-transplant, with rates as high as 32% and chronic GVHD rates at about 9%. 259 Additionally, some patients may develop mixed chimerism necessitating regular donor lymphocyte infusions. 30 With reduced intensity conditioning at an experienced transplant center, patients surviving to HSCT have an approximate survival rate of 92%. 202 The unifying thread of all treatments is that the best success rates occur when complete remission is achieved rapidly and HSCT closely follows."
1214,2415235,"A retrospective report of COVID-19 patients from Wuhan described encephalopathy, or persistent (>24 hr) alterations in consciousness, in roughly one-fifth of individuals succumbing to the disease . Notably, blood plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., Neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 6 interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R) were significantly higher among fatal COVID-19 cases, indicative of hypercytokinemia, or ""cytokine storm syndrome,"" which was also reported in SARS-CoV-1 (Huang et al., 2005) , and may underlie encephalopathy. Beyond the acute effects of cytokine storm, a recent meta-analysis of delirium among intensive care patients of mixed conditions reported evidence of persistent neurocognitive deficits up to 18 months post-discharge (Salluh et al., 2015) , including mild cognitive impairment (Chung et al., 2020) .

1216,2706450,"Betacoronaviruses-b ancestors, meaning SARSr-CoVs ancestors, could have been historically hosted by the common ancestor of the Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae and could have later evolved independently in the lineages leading towards Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae betacoronaviruses. This point of view is supported by the topology of Betacoronavirus clade that exhibits the monophyly of Rhinolophidae betacoronaviruses despite their broad geographic distribution (from Africa and central Europe to South-East Asia and Northern Australia - Fig. 1 ) and shows the close relationship of Hipposideridae betacoronaviruses. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that putative host switching between Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae betacoronaviruses (ancestors), eventually associated with ancient migration events, would still be detectable. More investigations are necessary to address these points and test corresponding hypotheses. As well, new investigations would be necessary to confirm this suggested predominant influence of the host phylogeny on Betacoronavirus-b clustering and whether other lineage would exist in Hipposideridae, as suggested by the report of a Betacoronavirus from Australia (C.

PIV is responsible for 20-40% of lower respiratory tract infections and is the second most common viral cause of hospitalization in children. 166 With contemporary molecular diagnostics, PIV has also been demonstrated to be the second or third most commonly isolated virus in hospitalized adults, aged 16-64 years old. [167] [168] [169] In both adults and children, re-infection is common despite the presence of antibodies formed during prior infection. 170 In tropical and subtropical regions, parainfluenza viruses do not show seasonal variations, while in temperate regions, such as the USA, PIV-1 and PIV-2 cause seasonal outbreaks in the fall (September-December) and PIV-3 causes epidemics during the spring (April-June). 171, 172 In years when there is no PIV-1 circulating (typically even-numbered years), PIV-3 activity is generally greater. 172 PIV-4, which generally causes a milder degree of illness, is more common in the autumn and winter months. 173 Parainfluenza is one of the more common causes of respiratory viral infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or solid organ transplantation and is associated with a high rate of progressive disease involving the lower airway and an increased mortality rate. 174, 175 Pathogenicity Parainfluenza viruses are transmitted by direct person-to-person contact through large respiratory droplets and contact with fomites contaminated with respiratory secretions. 176 Clinical symptoms typically develop after a 2-6 day incubation period. After initial infection PIV-3 is associated with more distal lung involvement, particularly in the first 6 months of life. 161, 197 PIV-4 is generally associated with mild upper respiratory infections or asymptomatic infection, although more severe disease has been described in children with underlying cardiopulmonary disease or immune compromise. 161, 198 Nonrespiratory complications of PIV include meningitis, myocarditis, pericarditis, and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. [199] [200] [201] [202] ADULT DISEASE PIV is responsible for 1-15% of acute, typically mild respiratory illnesses in adults with higher rates and more significant morbidity in older adults. 203, 204 Higher rates of pneumonia (11-14%) have been described in the elderly. 205, 206 Wider use of more sensitive molecular assays have demonstrated that PIV is a significant cause of communityacquired pneumonia and exacerbations of asthma and chronic bronchitis.

1220,2457336,"RNAi therapeutics represent a fundamentally new way to treat human disease by addressing targets that are otherwise 'undruggable' with existing medicines. The discovery of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mediated RNAi in the worm 1 and the subsequent demonstration that RNAi, mediated by small-interfering RNA (siRNA), operates in mammalian cells 2 sparked an explosion of research to uncover new mechanisms of gene silencing, revolutionizing our understanding of endogenous mechanisms of gene regulation and providing powerful new tools for biological research and drug discovery. From the first in vivo evidence of RNAi-based therapeutic efficacy in an animal disease model in 2003 (REF. 3 ), the pace of drug development has been rapid. Three phase I studies to investigate RNAibased drugs for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of paediatric hospitalizations in the United States today, have already been completed without untoward toxicity. Despite the promise, real hurdles need to be overcome to translate the therapeutic potential of RNAi into clinical reality. An important milestone will be the clear demonstration of efficacy in well-controlled human clinical studies."
1221,619248,"With modest additional effort, we can generalize Theorem 6.1 to the multiple stage SI n R model, i.e., the usual final size formula (5) is still valid if there are multiple infectious stages and the durations of each stage are arbitrarily distributed. Recall that latent stages can be considered infectious stages with zero transmission rate, so we do not make any explicit reference to latency. As in all the situations considered above, we assume that vital dynamics (births and deaths) can be ignored and that recovery entails lifelong immunity."

1223,1231466,"The coronaviruses comprise a large group of enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses and cause a variety of infections in a wide range of animal hosts (Garwes, 1982; Siddell et at., 1983) . Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) Is a coronavirus that causes gastroenteritis in pigs, resulting in a high mortality among neonates. TGEV is composed of a capped polyadenylated single-stranded RNA genome of M, 6.8x10^ or 20 kb in length (Garwes et al.. 1975; Dennis and Brian, 1981) and three major structural polypeptides: a surface glycoprotein (spike or peplomer protein) with a monomeric M. 200 000, a giycosylated integral membrane protein observed as a series of potypeptides of M, 28000-31 000, and a basic phos-phorylated protein {the nucleoprotein) of M, 47000 associated with the viral RNA (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . Infection of susceptible cells with TGEV results in the synthesis of a 'nested"" set of subgenomic mRNA species with common 3' termini but different extensions in the 5' direction, a phenomenon also observed with other coronaviruses such as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, Stern and Kennedy. 1980) , though the size and number of the mRNA species vary with the virus. TGEV appears to have, in addition to the genomic sized RNA species, four major (11.2.3.9,2.6 and 1.7 kb) and two low abundant (3.0 and 0.7 kb) mRNA species (Britton etal., 1986; Jacobs etal., 1986) ."
1224,920291,"Patients with uncomplicated (mild to moderate) illness usually have signs that include mild fever, dry cough, sore throat, respiratory irritation, fatigue, stomach aches and malaise, whereas reported dyspnea in patients were asymptomatic [15] . Nonrespiratory signs such as diarrhea are challenging to identify relative to prior HCoV infections. Moderate pneumonia respiratory signs such as cough and shortness of breath (or children's tachypnea, etc.) were reported for patients with some cases [13] . Extreme pneumonia fever is caused by heavy illnesses, respiratory depression or hypoxia (SpO2 <90% in the room). Fever is consistent with extreme pneumonia [30] . Nevertheless, fever signs thought to be correctly recognized as mild or sometimes missing, even in extreme cases of the disease. In children, cyanosis can occur. The description includes a psychiatric condition, and radiological terminology is used to remove complications with clinical and ventilatory requirements that are needed for this diagnosis [13] .

1225,2953074,"Previous studies showed that some coronaviruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus, murine hepatitis virus, and human coronavirus 229E, are susceptible to type I interferons in vitro or in vivo (4-7). Therefore, we evaluated the in vitro efficacy of a recombinant human type I interferon (IFN), IFN-β 1a (Serono International, Geneva, Switzerland) against three different isolates of SARS-CoV (Tor2 and Tor7 and Urbani) using yield reduction assays. The IFN-β 1a preparation employed in this study was selected because it is currently used as part of the most effective treatment regimen for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (8) , and more importantly, because it was shown to have antiviral activity (as measured in a vesicular stomatitis virus cytopathic assay system) 14 times greater than the currently available treatment using IFN-β 1b (9) ."
1226,555873,"Few studies of the human virome have considered the effects of contaminants in reagents and nucleic acid extraction kits on viral metagenomes (Table S1 ), though these are being increasingly recognised in prokaryote-focused studies. 26, 69, 70 Nucleases, proteases and polymerases used in studies are produced in protein expression systems, and sequences associated with these expression vectors have been detected in virome studies. 70 Columns used to purify DNA may introduce parvovirus-like, circoviruses/densoviruses and iridoviruses sequences into samples, and it has been suggested their use should be avoided in virome studies. 26, 70 Efforts should be made to prevent cross-contamination of samples when processing samples for nucleic acid extraction and sequencing. 26, 70 Low-biomass samples obtained from non-GI sites will be reliant on PCR-based approaches for the foreseeable future, and these are most likely to be affected by contaminants in reagents.

1227,357816,"In this communication, we report that the ability of A59 to stimulate MHC class I expression during acute infection in primary murine astrocytes, previously observed by Suzumura et al. (33, 53, 54) , is not an inherent property of MHV strains. It is interesting to note that the strains that did not stimulate class I are derivatives of the highly neurotropic MHV-4, or JHMV strain, whereas most of the MHV strains that did are the more hepatotropic strains. However, class I-inducing in JHMV was also not due to poor replication efficiency in astrocytes, since JHMV infected the same percentage of cells and produced similar levels of infectious virus as the class I-inducing MHV strains (Table 3) . Thus, some other MHV characteristic must be responsible for class I-inducing activity, or the lack thereof. Since the expression of class I genes is regulated by interferons (55) , it seemed possible that class I induction might correlate with the ability of MHV strains to stimulate IFN production. This possibility gains credibility from reports that JHMV is a notoriously poor inducer of interferon after in vitro (56) and in vivo (57) infection. However, Suzumura et al. (53) did not detect IFNs in UV-treated supernatants from A59-infected mixed glial cells in spite of the presence of class I-inducing activity, and our findings indicate that A59-induced class I expression was not inhibited by antibodies to IFN-a/3 or -3' (Table 4 ). Unlike Suzumura et al. (53), we did not find that class I-inducing activity was retained after UV-inactivation of A59 or the A59-1ike recombinant MHV strains (Table 4) , and it was not detected in supernarants from A59-infected astrocytes that were UV-treated to inactivate infectious virus (Table 5 and Fig. 5 ). In addition, we have recently found that class I expression is no longer observed when A59 replication is controlled by the culture of persistently infected astrocytes in the presence of MHVspecific polyclonal antiserum, in spite of the persistence of viral protein and RNA (58) . Overall, our data suggest that class I induction by MHV in astrocytes requires infectious virus and does not involve the secretion of a soluble factor. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the class I-inducing activity originally reported by Suzumura et al. (33, 53) was also dependent on continuous virus production in glial cell cultures prepared from the brains of infected mice (54) . However, it is possible that our lack of detection of class I-inducing activity in the supernatants could reflect culture, or other technical conditions. Although it was not possible to attribute class I-inducing activity to a single gene or gene product using the A59/JHMV recombinant virus strains, the data clearly indicate that class I-inducing activity maps to the 3' end of the A59 genome, which contains the genes encoding the primary structural proteins S, M, and N, and two poorly understood nonstructural proteins. However, there are some indications that S is the most likely candidate. For example, recombinant strains which retain more A59 sequences in the S gene tended to be more potent than those retaining less A59, or moreJHMV character. In addition, the S gene shows the greatest antigenic divergence of the structural proteins between A59 and JHMV (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) and so might be more likely to exhibit differences in activity. This possibility is supported by data indicating that A59 andJHMV differ considerably in their ability to cause receptor-independent fusion and syncytium formation (59) . In addition, preliminary data suggest that A59 and JHMV may show selective binding to the cellular receptors for MHV (60) , which are members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family of proteins (61) ."

Influenza B demonstrated a slight increase in EC 50 when exposed to CPC for 10 passages that was not significant. Of note, influenza B susceptibility to CPC continued to be comparable to that of influenza A. These results suggested that CPC has a low potential to select for influenza virus resistance consistent with its mechanism of action."
1229,2133555,"On the basis of the significant genetic differences between the reference and the Elmo/02-like CCoVs our tentative proposal is to designate the new genotype identified as CCoV type I, and to designate the reference strains, such as Insavc-1 and K378, as CCoVs type II. This new designation does not take into account the order of discovery of the viruses, but it is based on the genetic similarity between CCoVs type II and FCoVs type II and between CCoV type I and FCoV type I."
1230,2436295,"The origin of N4/02 is currently unknown. Mutation, as a mechanism, could not explain the origin of N4/02. If the VicS vaccine, the strain most closely related genetically to N4/02, was an ancestor, then the VicS S1 gene would have had to undergo multiple mutations throughout the entire S1 gene. Such a high mutation rate has not been encountered thus far in IBV, either in field or experimental infections [9, 10] . Accumulation of mutations over time could have given rise to strains that bear some similarity with N4/02, and from which N4/02 could have further evolved by mutations. However, monitoring of broilers for IBV variants over recent years did not detect any such strains (37, J. Ignjatovic and K. Mardani, unpublished results). If recombination was involved in the generation of N4/02, two different viruses could have been the source of the S1 gene and N gene/3 UTR. Such a recombination event is theoretically feasible since regions between the S1 and N genes are involved in recombination [4, 30] . However, while the source virus for the N gene and 3 UTR might have been a subgroup 1 strain of IBV such as N1/62, the source of the S1 gene is unknown. The origin of two other similar strains, D1466 and DE072 [15, 28] , is also unclear. Differences between the S1 gene sequences of the DE072 and D1466 and other IBV strains indicate that they did not originate directly from live vaccine viruses or other common IBV strains [15] . Instead, it is speculated that D1466 and DE072 had the same origin, which is different from other IBVs [31] , but that two viruses diverged a long time ago and evolved independently in different geographical locations [30] . Although this might have happened, it is not clear what their origin is and, if they have evolved over time, why strains with some S1 sequence similarity to either D1466 or DE072 had not been detected in either location prior to their sudden emergence."
1231,2033148,"In addition, the pathological changes in SARS patients were associated with complicated cytokines dysregulation; moreover, the Th1/Th2 cytokine imbalance was closely correlated with the severity and outcome of SARS-CoV infection [31] [32] [33] [34] . Zhang et al. had reported that IL-6 was positively correlated with SARS severity while IL-8 and TGF-␤ were negatively correlated with SARS  severity in patient serum, and furthermore, IL-4, IL-10, and IFN-␥ only showed changes in convalescent SARS patients [31, 35] . However, another report showed that IFN-␥, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 but not IL-2, IL-10, and IL-4 were up-regulated in SARS patients before and after treatment [35] . A serum analysis of acute SARS patients (n = 98) showed substantial elevation of IFN-␥, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, but not IL-2, IL-4, and TNF-␣ before any treatment [34] . As a key immunogen of SARS-CoV, the regulatory function of N protein on cytokines also showed complex pattern in animal system. For example, the vaccination of mice with recombinant baculovirus expressing SARS N protein resulted in augment of IFN-␥-and IL-4secreting CD4+ cells, though IFN-␥ secretion level was much high than that of IL-4, which indicated predominant Th1 response [25] . However, prior immunization of mice with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing SARS-CoV N protein and later SARS-CoV virus challenge caused significant expansion of both Th1 (IFN-g, IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5) cytokines, reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-␤), as well as severe pneumonia [36, 37] . The induction of IFN-␥ [25, 28, 29] , IL-6 [37] , IL-11 [38] and other cytokines was also observed to related with SARS-N protein. Therefore, it is worthy to evaluate the cytokine changes in our system specially regarding of Th1 and Th2 response."

1234,1014200,"Autophagy provides a short-term supply of amino acids in response to starvation by delivering damaged organelles and longlived proteins to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy begins with the nucleation of phagophores, which then expand to form double-membrane autophagosomes able to sequester portions of the cytosol. 1 Autophagy is initiated by sequential interactions between the nutrient-sensing MTOR kinase and ULK1 protein complex (UKC). UKC is a complex of ULK1, ATG13, RB1CC1/ FIP200, and ATG101. In nutrient-rich conditions MTOR is active and phosphorylates ATG13 within the UKC. However, following starvation or nutrient depletion MTOR is inactivated, and ULK1 increases phosphorylation of RB1CC1. These changes enable the UKC to bind a second protein complex containing BECN1/Vps30/Atg6, ATG14, and a class 3 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, whose catalytic subunit is termed PIK3C3. 2 The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one of several sources of lipids for autophagosome formation. Anchoring of ATG14 to the ER 3 and/or ER-mitochondrial contact sites, 4 plays a key role in recruiting the BECN1-ATG14-PIK3C3 complex from the cytosol to sites of autophagosome formation in response to starvation. Localized phosphorylation of lipids by PIK3C3 generates ER domains called omegasomes enriched in phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (Ptdlns3P) that recruit Ptdlns3P-effector proteins such as WIPI1/2 to generate sites able to prime phagophore Autophagy is a cellular response to starvation that generates autophagosomes to carry long-lived proteins and cellular organelles to lysosomes for degradation. Activation of autophagy by viruses can provide an innate defense against infection, and for (+) strand RNA viruses autophagosomes can facilitate assembly of replicase proteins. We demonstrated that nonstructural protein (NsP) 6 of the avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (iBV), generates autophagosomes from the eR. A statistical analysis of MAP1Lc3B puncta showed that NsP6 induced greater numbers of autophagosomes per cell compared with starvation, but the autophagosomes induced by NsP6 had smaller diameters compared with starvation controls. small diameter autophagosomes were also induced by infection of cells with iBV, and by NsP6 proteins of MhV and sARs and NsP5, NsP6, and NsP7 of arterivirus PRRsV. Analysis of WiPi2 puncta induced by NsP6 suggests that NsP6 limits autophagosome diameter at the point of omegasome formation. iBV NsP6 also limited autophagosome and omegasome expansion in response to starvation and Torin1 and could therefore limit the size of autophagosomes induced following inhibition of MTOR signaling, as well as those induced independently by the NsP6 protein itself. MAP1Lc3B-puncta induced by NsP6 contained sQsTM1, which suggests they can incorporate autophagy cargos. however, NsP6 inhibited the autophagosome/lysosome expansion normally seen following starvation. Taken together the results show that coronavirus NsP6 proteins limit autophagosome expansion, whether they are induced directly by the NsP6 protein, or indirectly by starvation or chemical inhibition of MTOR signaling. This may favor coronavirus infection by compromising the ability of autophagosomes to deliver viral components to lysosomes for degradation. formation and expansion. [5] [6] [7] The omegasome was first identified by analyzing the translocation of ZFYVE1/DFCP1 to punctate structures aligned along the ER. 5 ZFYVE1 binds to PtdIns3P and can be used to identify the omegasome and subsequent autophagosome. The activated PIK3C3-BECN1 complex also promotes ubiquitin-like reactions, which generate an ATG12-ATG5-ATG16 conjugate, and add phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to MAP1LC3B/ATG8. Recruitment of the MAP1LC3B-PE conjugate (also known as LC3-II) results in phagophore expansion and eventual release of autophagosomes into the cytosol. LC3-II is the major protein of the autophagosome and remains with the autophagosome until fusion with the lysosomes. 8, 9 For this reason immunodetection, or green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging of MAP1LC3 has become indispensable for visualizing autophagosomes in mammalian cells."

However, rela tively few studies emphasized that dramatic reform also affected employment and associated welfare benefits. Chen (2005) has noticed unemployment and social security sustainability problem after reforms. Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping directed the Chinese economy to build ''socialism with Chinese characteristics''. This direction essentially allowed all enterprises to participate in a market economy while still keeping the ownership of the state. However, there was no clear statement as of how this goal would affect the welfare provision in China. As state firms faced fierce competition and financial troubles, were they still able to continue providing welfare benefits? Moreover, the urban and rural gap in the economic conditions has become larger. The report in the New York Times (Jan 14th, 2000) noted that ''the collapse of socialized medicine and staggering cost increases [opened] a yawning gap between health care in the cities and the rural areas'', which had the consequences that ''absence of adequate health care.spread infectious diseases like hepatitis and tuberculosis and making the country and the world more vulnerable to epidemics like severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, and possibly bird flu.

1241,757729,"Although we failed to reliably detect coronavirus genomic RNA in blood at any stage of experimental infection with a field strain of Type I FIPV, others have reported a viremia using an identical RT-qPCR procedure (Gut et al., 1999) . However, closer examination of these studies indicates that detection of feline coronavirus genomic RNA has not been as clear-cut as assumed, mainly because detection is often at or beyond the limits of reliability for the assay procedure. Three studies reported on the detection of feline coronavirus RNA in blood, but all were concerned with FECV rather than FIPV infection and detection was inconsistent (Meli et al., 2004; Kipar et al., 2010; Vogel et al., 2010) . Kipar et al. (2001 Kipar et al. ( , 2006 compared virus loads in various tissues, excluding blood, in naturally infected cats and indicated that virus loads were higher in FIPV than FECV infected cats. Gunn-Moore et al. (1998b) used RT-PCR to detect FIPV genomic RNA in whole blood or plasma of 80-90% cats with FIP, both directly and after co-cultivation with WFE cells; plasma was just as likely to test positive as whole blood. However, they also found that 83-89% of healthy cats from FECV enzootic households also tested positive. de Groot-Mijnes et al. (2005) described a viremic phase in a subset of cats with FIP but virus loads were derived from RT-qPCR and RT-PCR data, as well as other data not shown. Moreover, virus levels where elevated usually at week one and terminally and were usually associated with CT values from 36 to 40. We conclude that viremia even in cats with highly fulminant experimentally induced FIP is either nonexistent or below the reliable detection limits of highly sensitive RT-qPCR at all stages of the infection. Virus detection should concentrate on tissues and effusions containing FIPV infected macrophages."

It is important to be cognizant of the fact that these are early generation tests for SARS-CoV-2.

1246,655087,"COVID-19 is associated with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell lymphopenia, which may result from a combination of virus-induced direct cytopathic effects, as well as enhanced T-cell apoptosis due to a dysregulated cytokine milieu [14, 15] . CD4+ T-cells are important for modulating the immune response, and the CD4+ T-lymphopenia observed in SARS was thought to contribute to hyperinflammation through impaired downregulation of the inflammatory process [16, 17] . Furthermore, CD4+ Tlymphopenia may impair the adaptive antiviral response through inadequate T-cell help to virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells and Bcells."

Thus binding of PRRSV on the host cells does not necessary lead to a productive infection, the basis for the restricted replication of PRRSV in certain cell types being found in the different subsequent steps that have to be passed through successfully before new viral particles are produced: internalization, release of the viral genome, transcription, translation and assembly [36] ."

1252,637708,"Contribution number ten, ""Consumer Reacting, Coping and Adapting Behaviors in the COVID-19 Pandemic,"" is written by Colleen P. Kirk and Laura S. Rifkin. In it, the authors explore numerous consumer insights during a major pandemic outbreak. Mainly, they examine consumer behaviors across three phases: reacting (e.g., hoarding and rejecting), coping (e.g., maintaining social connectedness, do-it-yourself behaviors, and changing views of brands), and longer-term adapting (e.g., potentially transformative changes in consumption and individual and social identity). The authors also identify a number of negative aspects of the pandemic that will likely impact consumer behavior. As they state, given the mandatory close quarters people must keep due to stay-at-home requirements, domestic abuse may be on the rise. In addition, throughout history, pandemics provide an excuse for increased racial and anti-immigrant biases."

Of the patients studied, only 7.7% used condoms consistently [53] . One study showed high STI prevalence among drivers/conductors and migrant workers of sexually active age group [54] . Hence, STI is more common in Districts with highways running through. When, these sexual behaviors and relationships are considered, STI in the community appears to be spreading fast but go unrecorded as many patients get treated confidentially at private clinics. Therefore, the burden of STIs appears to be huge in Nepal [54] ."
1254,2524254,"It is not yet known whether people with DM are more susceptible to COVID-19, but several studies have reported a greater risk of severe COVID-19 in diabetic patients. [3, 4] Diabetic individuals have a greater risk of respiratory infections due to compromised immune system, especially the innate immunity. [5, 37] Even transient hyperglycaemia may temporarily affect innate immune responses to infection. [38] It was hypothesized that ACE2 may be the key pathfinder of COVID-19 severity in diabetic individuals. [5] ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein expressed in the epithelial cells of cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, brain and intestinal tissue, it acts by breaking down angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7. [37, 39, 40] This enzyme acts by counteracting the inflammatory actions of angiotensin II, lowering the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6, increasing the anti-inflammatory, and increasing the antioxidant action of angiotensin 1-7, escalating the levels of surfactant protein D and promoting vasodilation. [41] The novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 is expected to act similary to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). Both utilize ACE2 to bind and gain entry to the host pneumocytes. [39] Viral surface spike (S) protein of COVID-19 binds to ACE2 after spike protein activation by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). [40] Routine use of ACEI and ARB as a medication for chronic conditions upregulates ACE2 expression, [5, 37] thereby facilitating entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the pneumocytes and consequently cause severe and fatal infection. [42] Among other diabetic medications, the use of liraglutide and pioglitazone have also been found to be related with increased ACE2 regulation in animal studies. [42, 43] The interconnection between ACE2, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) signalling, aging, DM, hypertension, and severity of COVID-19 may not be as simple as it may seem. As we described before, our meta-regression analysis showed that the association between DM and poor outcome was interdependent on age and hypertension. One of the possible rationale behind this finding is the use of medications, particularly ACEI or ARB in hypertensive individuals. The risks and benefits associated with ACEI/ARB use in COVID-19 patients remains controversial [44] , a specific type of ARB has been shown to ameliorate lung injury in SARS-CoV infection in animal model. [45] It is unfortunate that all of the included studies did not provide report on diabetic or hypertensive medications."

Although one observation (Daegu province in South Korea) was identified as an outlier and had high leverage, the model results did not change when this observation was removed from the dataset. The model results indicate that there was a negative correlation in the predicted number of cases with temperature from 1°C and above ( Figure  2 ). For example, at mean values for the other variables, an increase in average temperature from 1°C to 9°C was associated with a decrease in predicted cases at ADM1 level from 24 cases to 19 cases, respectively. Similarly, an increase in average temperature from 10°C to 19°C was associated with a decrease from 18 to 7 predicted cases at ADM1 level, respectively. The pseudo R-squared values for the final model with and without temperature were 0.44 and 0.39, respectively, indicating that the inclusion of the temperature effect only provided a relatively modest improvement in model fit."

These measures include schools and universities closure, reduced working hours, and increased production and delivery of equipment such as masks, gloves and hygienic materials for sterile environments. The government has also made efforts to divulge high-quality information concerning the COVID-19 and to provide laboratories and hospitals with diagnostic kits and adequate resources to treat patients. However, despite such efforts, the number of cases and deaths has progressively increased with rising trends in total confirmed cases and deaths, as well as in new daily cases and deaths associated with the COVID-19. Iran is a developing country and its economic infrastructure has been hit hardly by embargo and sanctions. While developed countries have allocated appropriate funding and are responding adequately to the COVID-19 pandemics, Iran has experienced a serious surge of cases and deaths and should strive to provide additional resources to the health system to make healthcare services more accessible and to increase the fairness of that access.

Outbreaks of viral respiratory illness threaten public health but the associated extrapulmonary manifestations and their prolonged consequences are frequently overlooked. COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving epidemic with uncertain clinical characteristics and further acceleration seems likely. 19 Pre-existing cardiovascular disease may contribute to adverse early clinical outcomes and infection may have longer-term implications for overall cardiovascular health (Take home figure) .

1265,1404675,"Asthma is the most frequent chronic respiratory disease, affecting up to 10% of children. 1,2 Asthma induced by allergens has been studied intensively and the pathogenesis is well defined. In addition to allergens, respiratory viruses have been proven to be important factors in provoking asthmatic attacks. 2-4 Virus-induced damage to the respiratory epithelium results in locally intensified activity of various cells involved in the immune response. 5, 6 The presence of viruses in the respiratory tract forms a permanent source of foreign proteins, which might be the cause of subsequent pathological changes. 7 Rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and other paramixoviruses are most frequently presumed to be the potential cause of virus-induced asthma exacerbation. [8] [9] [10] A vast number of virus and host characteristics dictate the type of infection, either persistent or latent, and determine host response and the resulting development of the disease. [11] [12] [13] Destruction of the infected cell or reorganization of viral antigens within the cell or on the cell membranes are commonly considered to be the conse-quence of virus infection. The host's immune system should finally destruct viruses. 4 In this study nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from asthmatic children whose asthma was well controlled, and when they were at least 3 weeks free of any respiratory infections.

Among these 48 cases, there was an interesting case in which the patient presented with a skin rash with petechiae. Because dengue is very common in our setting, petechiae rash is a common clinical finding in dengue, and the patient also had low platelet count, a clinical diagnosis of dengue was made by the first physician in charge. There was no photograph and a biopsy was not done because biopsy is not a routine practice according to dengue clinical practice guidelines in our tropical setting. The patient was initially misdiagnosed as dengue, which resulted in a delayed diagnosis. 3 In this case, the patient further presented respiratory problems and was referred to the tertiary medical center. Other common virus infections that might cause fever, rash, and respiratory problem were ruled out by laboratory investigation, and the final diagnosis of COVID-19 infection was confirmed by RT-PCR."

Our estimate of the mean reproduction number in the confined setting reached values as high as ~11, which is higher than mean estimates reported from community-level transmission dynamics in China and Singapore (approximate range: 1.1-7). Our findings suggest that R t decreased substantially compared to values during the early phase after the Japanese government implemented an enhanced quarantine control.

1270,2822880,"Many viral infections are accompanied by delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses; however, the role of the DTH response in viral pathogenesis or resistance is unclear (Liew, 1982) . DTH is an antigen-specific response mediated by T cells which express the CD4 cell surface marker and respond to antigen presented in the context of major histocompatability complex (MHC) class II molecules. Antigen-induced activation of TDT H cells results in the release of lymphokines, increased vascular permeability and the local accumulation of antigen-nonspecific monocytes (Liew, 1982; Askenase and Van Loveren, 1983; Geczy, 1984) . Our laboratory has previously shown that the adoptive transfer of CD4 ÷ cell TDT H clones specific for the neurotropic JHMV strain of mouse hepatitis virus protects mice from death due to a lethal infection . Protection requires only a small number (5 x 104) of these clonal T cells, is MHC class II (I-A) restricted, is prevented by immunosuppression of the host and results in the accumulation of large numbers of perivascular mononuclear cells . These characteristics are consistent with the induction of a DTH response (Liew, 1982) . The data suggest that the DTH-stimulated local accumulation of monocytes within the central nervous system (CNS) may play a pivotal role in providing protection to the host from a lethal infection. In addition, protection was not accompanied by a reduction of virus in the CNS, which suggests that the DTH response may play a role in the establishment of persistent JHMV infection in the CNS, leading to chronic JHMVinduced demyelination (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) ."
1271,1728364,"In the classic description of influenza-associated lower respiratory tract complications during the H2N2 pandemic of 1957-1958, Louria et al. [9] described 4 syndromes: (1) no radiographic pneumonia, (2) viral infection followed by bac-terial pneumonia, (3) rapidly progressive diffuse viral pneumonia, and (4) concomitant viral-bacterial pneumonia. Today, pure viral pneumonia is uncommon, perhaps because prior infection and vaccination has induced immunity among older persons, as well as the rarity of rheumatic heart disease. We found that 2%-6% of highly vaccinated elderly persons (i.e., 190%) in the community developed influenza each season, of whom 5% had pneumonia. Only 30% of hospitalized patients with influenza have radiographic infiltrates, whereas a equal percentage have findings consistent with congestive heart failure or other diseases [10] . The true incidence of secondary bacterial pneumonia during influenza is unknown, largely because there are difficulties involved in accurate diagnosis of bacterial infection. In our recent study [10] , bacterial infection was identified in 10% of hospitalized patients with influenza, with only 1 episode of Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteremia. Dual viralbacterial infections were more severe than were viral infections alone, as evidence by higher rates of intensive care use and morbidity."
1272,2889122,"Viral proteins and RNA were detected in virions by IEM and ISH (Figure 2A,B) , and in association with double-membrane vesicles ( Figure 3A,B) , nucleocapsid inclusions, and large granular areas of cytoplasm ( Figure  4C ,D). Double-membrane vesicles have been noted in other coronavirus-infected cells (19, 20) and consist of cytoplasmic vesicles with two tightly apposed membranes ( Figure 1B) . In contrast, double-membrane vesicles in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells typically were composed of accumulations of multiple single-membrane vesicles enclosed within an outer membrane ( Figure 3C) , and virus particles were sometimes located between the two membranes ( Figure 3D ). Many double-membrane vesicles contained diffuse, granular material. Cytoplasmic inclusions of darkly staining viral nucleocapsids were mostly found in association with virus-containing vesicles or dou-ble-membrane vesicles (Figures 1B and 3D) .

1273,1196071,"In this study, we evaluated the performance of the novel RV16 assay with those of RV15 assay and viral culture. RV16 and RV15 assays offered good sensitivities (79.5-100%) for the detection of common respiratory viral agents (influenza A or B, PIV 1-3, RSVA or B), while viral culture showed low sensitivities (45.8-69.2%). As for adenovirus, the RV16 assay showed superior sensitivity to RV15 (98.4% vs. 52.4), while viral culture demonstrated low sensitivity (23.0%). In our study, twenty-eight ADV-positive specimens were detected by RV16 alone. A confirmatory sequencing demonstrated that nineteen, six, two and one specimens were adenovirus C, B, F (41) and D type, respectively. In a previous study, through evaluating the four commercial multiplex PCR assays, the performance for adenovirus was not as good as the other viruses, assuming due to various serologic types of adenovirus. 12 In addition, the molecular assays detected viral pathogens from culture negative 282 (39%) samples. The overall detection rate in our study was similar to those in the previous reports. As for RV15, a Chinese study based on 164 nasopharyngeal swab presented the detection rate of 78.7% for all target respiratory viruses, 9 while a Canadian study based on 750 nasopharyngeal swabs showed the detection rate of 66.9%. 12 As for Seegene RV12, a Korean study performed on 101 respiratory specimen from 92 patients showed the detection rate of 75.2% for all target respiratory viruses, 3 while other Canadian study using 231 nasopharyngeal specimen demonstrated 69.8%. 6 Viral culture has limited ability to detect some viruses. 16 Rhinovirus is difficult to detect by viral culture due to its diversity of serotypes. In our study, only RV16 and RV15 detected 125 rhinoviruses (24%) from 529 culture negative samples. Although MPV causes a lower respiratory disease similar to that caused by RSV, 17 it is difficult to detect MPV by cell culture due to its selective, 6, [10] [11] [12] Given that the coronavirus and human bocavirus are recently discovered, and detected worldwide and sometimes associated with severe respiratory illness, RV16 will be helpful to take care of the patients who have previously had the undefined or fatal respiratory illness. 16, [18] [19] [20] The advantage of the PCR-based assay was detecting coinfections which are usually missed by viral culture. 6 In the literature, the detection rate of multiple infections by multiplex PCR assay ranged from 5% to 40%. 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 Whereas, similar to our study results, Gharabaghi et al. using multiplex PCR reported two, three and four viruses-infected specimens as 15.3, 0.8 and 0.2% of total respiratory specimens, respectively. Although the role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown, multiple agents may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. 12 RV16 assay would provide clinicians with better infectious status of patients than RV15 or culture, resulting in the more effective prevention of such multiple infections."

As at 5 March 2020, a total of 80,409 COVID-19 cases and 3,012 deaths (3.75%) have been reported in mainland China [5] . The 52,045 recovered cases (64.73%) were further quarantined at home for at least 2 weeks [5] . However, potential infectivity of these recovered cases was still unclear. Thus, we implemented consecutive virus surveillance among medical staff recovered from COVID-19 at our hospital and aimed to investigate their potential infectivity after discharge."
1276,1559074,"Five unrelated phage types, -1 var 3 (6 isolates), 3b var 2 (5), Dundee (2), Worksop (3), and RDNC (4), and 3 closely-related pulsed-field types, differing by only 1 to 3 of 14 bands in the Xba1 PFGE profiles, were identified in the 20 isolates studied; 2 of these pulsed-field types were observed in the electronically transmitted images of the 3 isolates from Scotland. These pulsed-field profile types have been designated SPTJXB001 through SPTJXB003. Of these, SPTJXB002 predominated, being present in 11 of the isolates studied, belonging to 3 phage types. SPTJXB001 was identified in 8 isolates of 3 phage types, and SPTJXB003 in the remaining isolate. PFGE type did not change over time. All isolates were plasmid-free, and resistances were not transferable, either directly or by mobilization after a self-conjugative plasmid was introduced into the strains. By PCR, all isolates possessed bla CARB-2 , cmlA, aadA2, sul1, and tetG but were negative for bla TEM, catI, and catIII. These results corresponded to those of the control DT104 ACSSpSuT strain P3170700. When tested for class 1 integrons, all S. Java isolates of Rtype ACSSpSuT produced characteristic amplicons of 1.0 and 1.2 kb, as did P3170700, but not the drug-"
1277,3054208,"The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) is a widely expressed potent antiviral effector of the host innate immune system. It restricts a diverse group of pathogenic, enveloped viruses, by interfering with endosomal fusion. In this report, the swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) gene was cloned. It shares the functionally conserved CD225 domain and multiple critical amino acid residues (Y19, F74, F77, R86 and Y98) with its human ortholog, which are essential for antiviral activity. Ectopic expression of sIFITM3 significantly inhibited non-enveloped foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in BHK-21 cells. Furthermore, sIFITM3 blocked FMDV infection at early steps in the virus life cycle by disrupting viral attachment to the host cell surface. Importantly, inoculation of 2-day-old suckling mice with a plasmid expressing sIFITM3 conferred protection against lethal challenge with FMDV. These results suggest that sIFITM3 is a promising antiviral agent and that can safeguard the host from infection with FMDV."
1278,143793,"Complement-fixing and neutralizing antibodies to MHV were detected in the sera of men and rats by Hartley et al. [19] and were interpreted as indication of infection by antigenically-related, species-specific viruses. This hypothesis has been confirmed in part by isolation of coronaviruses from man [18] . SDA agent and Parker's rat corona agent may be responsible for antibodies to MHV found in rats. Biologically, SDA virus behaves differently from known strains of MHV, since the former does not multiply in the Py-AL/ N cell line, which is highly susceptible to MHV [6] . In addition, SDA virus does not induce lesions compatible with those due to MHV if inoculated ic into infant mice or if inoculated ic or ip into cortisone-treated weanling mice. Therefore, our failure to detect antigenic differences between these agents by the complement-fixation test should be interpreted with caution. More information may be obtained for serologic differentiation by use of immune sera prepared by different schedules of immunization and then tested by neutralization, complement-fixation, fluorescent-antibody, and gel-diffusion methods."
1279,202235,"Four of the five MHV genes in Fig. 1 contain a potentially significant internal open reading frame (ORF) in the +l reading frame relative to the N protein ORF, beginning at nt 65 and terminating at nt 688. In each case, the protein encoded by this ORF is 207 residues in length (22.6-22.9 kDa) and is distinguished by a large excess of basic residues (calculated pl's of 10.6-1 1.1) as well as a relatively high (17Oh) leucine content (Fig. 4) . The MHV-JHM N gene contains a very similar ORF in the same position, but this is interrupted by a stop codon following the 16th amino acid residue. For all of the N genes, the start codon for the internal ORF occurs in a strong context for translation initiation, whereas the N protein start codon (nt l-3) and an intervening start codon (nt 26-28) both fall in suboptimal contexts. Thus, it is possible that the internal ORF may be translated by means of a ""leaky scanning"" mechanism (21) . Leucine-rich internal ORFs also have been noted within the N genes of bovine coronavirus (22) whether any of them are actually synthesized in coronavirus-infected cells."

[1, 2] On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic and advised all countries to take decisive actions to prevent and control the outbreak. [3] Thus far, as of April 16, 2020, COVID-19 has spread to 213 countries or territories and resulted in 1,954,724 confirmed cases and 126,140 deaths globally. [4] There is no effective vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and treatment options are still experimental. [1] Patients are just managed with supportive care and antibiotics against secondary bacterial infections. To fight this pandemic, many countries, including Saudi Arabia, locked their borders, started evacuating their citizens from other countries, and imposed different degrees of blockade locally to promote social distancing and, hence, controlling the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. In this editorial, we will discuss the adequacy of such measures to control COVID-19 epidemic locally and globally."

1283,1485036,"We herein showed that viruses persisted for days or even weeks on dry hydrophobic surfaces. The pattern of resistance of viruses toward drying, as illustrated in the model of CVB4, was not due to the heterogeneity of viral populations, as suggested by the results of iterative drying. Moreover, media compositions and component concentrations clearly played a role when virus suspensions were exposed to drying. The results of our study suggest that a subsequent increase in solute concentrations in droplets modulated the viability of viruses toward drying. Since the compositions of media play a role in the viability of viruses exposed to drying, the persistence of viruses in natural media (clinical or environmental), instead of defined media, need to be investigated. Further studies will be directed towards this line of investigation in our laboratory."

The ability to access and continue using contraception improves women's reproductive autonomy, reduces unintended pregnancies, and profoundly impacts both women's and family's lives, health, empowerment, and well-being, particularly in times of stress and hardship."
1286,2771824,"3 Background COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, represents an unprecedented public health emergency. Since the emergence of the virus in China at the end of 2019, worldwide spread has been rapid, with 7,823,289 cases and 431,541 deaths reported as of 15 th June 2020. 1 The growing burden of COVID-19 in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) is of particular concern given the relative lack of availability of healthcare. Experience to date has highlighted the substantial pressure COVID-19 epidemics place on health systems, leading to huge demand for therapeutic oxygen and mechanical ventilators, sufficient to overwhelm even comparatively well-resourced settings such as the US where there are an estimated 20-31 intensive care unit (ICU) beds per 100,000 people. In contrast, recent estimates suggest less than 1 ICU bed and 1 ventilator per 100,000 people across SSA. 2 In Senegal, following the identification of an imported case, the government set up a response plan covering the period February to July 2020 with several modular phases depending on the epidemiological situation at the time. 5, 7 Here we describe the current epidemiological situation using data collected from across the country. We calibrate a dynamical model of COVID-19 transmission to these data to investigate the potential impact of different mitigation and suppression strategies on mortality and health system capacity and explore possible future trajectories of the still nascent epidemic in Senegal."
1287,1844060,"During the SARS-CoV outbreak, most schools and factories in China remained open. Following the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and confirmation of many infected cases, China responded by locking down residents of Wuhan city, banning wildlife trade until the epidemic is over, and attempting to build two new hospitals in the city of Wuhan to specifically handle the new outbreak. It is currently unclear if these two hospitals will be able to handle a major outbreak in a city of 11 million residents. There is no definite information about the exact time of the start of the outbreak. That is why it is hard to assess how contagious the virus is (the rate of sustained spread) at the present time. However, it seems likely and plausible that it is highly contagious, based on the mounting data about human-to-human transmission outside China [42] . In order to be able to precisely assess the rate of sustained spread, information about numbers of cases and deaths (the overall number of patients) will need to be divided by the overall number of people at risk of acquiring the disease (the number of individuals who have been in contact with the patients). Once this is determined, the overall risk can be assessed."

Eleven naturally FIPV-infected cats from various animal shelters served as source of infection (Group IV) for SPF cats (Table 1) .

Therefore, D-dimer is often used to detect active thrombus with high sensitivity but low specificity. 16 But, if 3.0 µg/mL was used as the cut-off value, the sensitivity, specificity, and NPV were 76.9%, 94.9%, and 92.5%, respectively. After receiving anticoagulant therapy, the level of D-dimer decreased gradually, which means that D-dimer can not only predict thrombosis but also monitor the effectiveness of anticoagulants."
1290,2239263,"Among all the horseshoe bats, SARSr-CoVs are most commonly found in Chinese horseshoe bats and greater horseshoe bats. Detailed analysis of their genomes revealed several intriguing phenomena. Firstly, ORF1a and ORF1b in SARSr-Rf-BatCoV YNLF_31C isolated from greater horseshoe bats in Lufeng, Yunnan by our group has the highest nt identity to civet SARSr-CoV, especially at the regions nsp5, nsp10, nsp12 and nsp13 (Fig. 3A) . This raised the possibility that Lufeng, Yunnan could be a potential gene pool for the progenitor of ORF1 of SARS-CoV. Secondly, as previously illustrated, for most regions along the genome of SARSr-CoV except ORF8, SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs from Chinese horseshoe bats are predominantly closer to civet SARSr-CoV. However, the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV has higher a.a. identity to civet SARSr-CoV ORF8. In addition, V90 and I113 are the two Rf-specific residues present in the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV Rf4092, which could evolutionarily bridge the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV to SARSr-Rs-BatCoV that had very high identity to civet/human SARS-CoV (Fig. 5) . SARS-Rf-BatCoV was thus hypothesized to be the origin of human SARS-CoV ORF8 gene through recombination events."
1291,363760,"Because 3CL pro is responsible for polyprotein maturation, it is a potential target for anti-SARS drug development. We had previously used a fluorescence-based assay to characterize the protease and identified some C2 symmetry peptidomimetic compounds and metal-conjugated compounds as inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL pro (15) (16) (17) . Other small molecules targeting SARS-CoV 3CL pro were identified from several compound libraries, including bifunctional aryl boronic acids (18), a quinolinecarboxylate derivative (19) , a thiophenecarboxylate (20) , and phthalhydrazide-substituted ketoglutamine analogues (21) . These are all active site inhibitors. The new structures presented here suggest the possibility of drug design targeting protease dimerization during maturation. Overall, our study provides insights to substrate recognition, protein maturation, and drug discovery for SARS 3CL pro ."
1292,1417353,"Every virus starts its life cycle by entering a susceptible host cell. The host cell-targeting ability of a virus is mainly determined by the presence of appropriate host cell receptors which are engaged by a virus. For successful host cell entry, enveloped viruses have evolved a diverse array of envelope glycoproteins on their membrane with different receptor association capabilities. The best-characterized example of this viral glycoprotein-host cell receptor relationship might be the interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) glycoprotein gp120 and the human T lymphocyte CD4 molecule. Due to its essential role in the overall virus life cycle, viral entry has been an attractive target for both vaccine and antiviral drug development with the goal of disrupting the binding of viral glycoproteins to host cell receptors. In addition, heavy and unique glycosylation patterns found only on viral glycoproteins provide another level of virus specificity, which could increase the selectivity of virus-targeting therapeutics and prophylactics. In this regard, the use of carbohydrate-binding proteins, collectively called ""lectins"", has been explored as a new therapeutic antiviral strategy. Recently discovered virus-targeting lectins include banana lectin [1] , cyanovirin [2] , microvirin [3] , scytovirin [4] , and griffithsin (GRFT) [5] . Among them, GRFT has been studied extensively for the development of Corresponding secondary -sheet structures are marked with yellow arrows based on the crystal structure of a GRFT dimer with mannose at a resolution of 1.78 Å [19] . Tyrosine and aspartate residues in three carbohydrate-binding domains, which are essential for mannose-binding, are noted with blue and orange arrows, respectively. Wildtype GRFT has a non-standard amino acid at position 31, but it is replaced by alanine (colored in red) in recombinant GRFT. The sequence display was generated by the RCSB protein data bank website (www.rcsb.org)."
1293,1209273,"The prognosis of AEx of IPF is poor, with most case series reporting very high short-term mortality rates [ 11 , 79 -83 ] . This is particularly true for those patients requiring mechanical ventilation. A systematic review of mechanical ventilation in IPF and respiratory failure ( n = 135), including AEx, reported a hospital mortality of 87 % [ 81 ] . Short-term mortality (within 3 months of hospital discharge) was 94 %. The routine use of mechanical ventilation in patients with AEx of IPF is not recommended in the international consensus guidelines because of its low likelihood of benefi t and high risk of complications and further suffering [ 58 ] . Careful consideration regarding intubation and goals of care must be made, given the poor prognosis associated with this condition. Ideally, a discussion concerning end-of-life issues should be held between the patient and their provider in the outpatient setting with the inclusion of the patient's family, if applicable."
1294,979221,"The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Southeast Asia and on other continents reached serious global epidemic proportions in 130 countries [1] [2] [3] . In the absence of a vaccine or effective therapeutic drugs, the key to preventing and controlling future epidemics is to block transmission of infection through a strict quarantine policy.

1296,3040480,"Infectious bronchitis (IB) is one of the major economically important poultry diseases distributed worldwide. It is caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and affects both galliform and nongalliform birds. Its economic impact includes decreased egg production and poor egg quality in layers, stunted growth, poor carcass weight, and mortality in broiler chickens. Although primarily affecting the respiratory tract, IBV demonstrates a wide range of tissues tropism, including the renal and reproductive systems. Thus, disease outcome may be influenced by the organ or tissue involved as well as pathotypes or strain of the infecting virus. Knowledge on the epidemiology of the prevalent IBV strains in a particular region is therefore important to guide control and preventions. Meanwhile previous diagnostic methods such as serology and virus isolations are less sensitive and time consuming, respectively; current methods, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP), and sequencing, offer highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic results, thus enabling the genotyping of new viral strains within the shortest possible time. This review discusses aspects on pathogenesis and diagnostic methods for IBV infection."
1297,1913993,"Aminopeptidase N is a well documented ectoenzyme that binds to the membrane through an N-terminal segment 5 , 12,13. Human aminopeptidase N is identical to CDB, a surface antigen of many myeloid cells 14 , It is a zinc-binding protease that catalyses the removal of N-terminal, preferentially neutral residues from peptides, It is expressed in many tissues at different levels 15 , the highest activity being found in the small intestinal mucosa, where the aminopeptidase represents about 8% of the protein content of the apical membrane of the differentiated enterocytes, and in the kidney brush border. It is also expressed to a lesser extent in liver, lung and colon, where the virus does replicate, but without causing the specific histopathological damage seen in the small intestine 16 • In the intestine, the distibution of the receptor and the site of multiplication of TGEV are thus strikingly correlated. This argues for a pivotal role of aminopeptidase N/CD13 in determining the tissue tropism of TGEV, Investigating the nature of the virus interaction with aminopeptidase N could provide a rationale for the design of an antiviral strategy against TGEV and related infections. To develop a monoclonal antibody against the HCV-229E receptor, we produced hybridomas against deoxycholatesolubilized membrane proteins of two HCV-229E-susceptible human cell lines (WI38 lung fibroblasts and HL60 myeloid leukaemia cells). A monoclonal antibody designated RBS protected WI38 and RD human cell lines from HCV-229E-induced cytopathic effects and protected WI38 cells from virus infection ( Fig. la-c) . RBS pretreatment reduced the number of HCV-229E-infected WI-38 cells at 10 h post-infection by 96%, compared with cells pretreated with control mouse ascites. By contrast, RBS did not inhibit replication of HCV-OC43 in WI38 or RD cells, indicating that the receptor specificities of HCV-OC43 and HCV-229E are different."
1298,1496065,"The WHO was a significant presence in mediating and communicating the risks concerning SARS. In the last decade or so the WHO-through the Office of Alert and Response Operations, Cluster on Communicable Diseases-has established programmes to support Member States in detecting and responding to epidemic emergencies; especially those that have the potential for serious international impact and involvement. The purpose of these programmes is to facilitate a rapid and appropriate response. For this the WHO has developed response assistance mechanisms at the country, regional and headquarters levels and, when necessary, can call upon the technical expertise of more than 120 partner institutions worldwide in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) (Heymann & Rodier, 2004) ."
1299,1021008,"Two major categories of emerging infections-newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases-can be defined, respectively, as diseases that are recognized in the human host for the first time; and diseases that historically have infected humans, but continue to appear in new locations or in drug-resistant forms, or that reappear after apparent control or elimination [1] . Emerging/ reemerging infections may exhibit successive stages of emergence. These stages include adaptation to a new host [11] , an epidemic/ pathogenic stage, an endemic stage, and a fully adapted stage in which the organism may become nonpathogenic and potentially even beneficial to the new host (e.g., the human gut microbiome) or stably integrated into the host genome (e.g., as endogenous retroviruses). Although these successive stages characterize the evolution of certain microbial agents more than others, they nevertheless can provide a useful framework for understanding many of the dynamic relationships between microorganisms, human hosts, and the environment."
1300,71920,"Previous studies found that ACE2 is related to the severity of acute respiratory syndrome induced by the SARS-CoV infection, and mediates the production of cytokines associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome [15, 16] (Fig. 4) . Moreover, ACE2 is also related to adaptive immune responses [17] . In this current study, GSEA analysis showed that the high expression of ACE2 was related to innate immune responses, adaptive immune responses, B cell regulation and cytokine secretion, as well as an enhanced inflammatory response induced by IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, IL-8. We speculate that the immune system dysfunction involved in the high expression of ACE2 is related to the symptoms of a cytokine storm. A clinical study in Wuhan pointed out that the levels of IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-8 were significantly increased in critically ill patients with new coronavirus infection, indicating that the pathologic process may involve an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [1] . This may be related to pyroptosis, which has been suggested as another pathogenic mechanism involved in COVID-19 infection. Pyroptosis is an inflammatory form of apoptosis. The fact that tissue injury and death may be related to a pro-inflammatory process resulting from the viral infection suggests that the use of IL-1β blockers or IL-18 blockers may have some benefit in COVID-19 patients."

One hundred ninety-four were confirmed (88.2%), 2 were probable (0.9%), and 24 patients were suspected (10.9%) for pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A virus. Of these, 113 patients were male (51.4%) with median age of 43 (IQR 32-55) years, and 188 (85.5%) were under 60 years of age. The mean SAPS3 score was 53.0 ± 16.2 and the mean SOFA score was 8.2 ± 4.2 on admission. Mechanical ventilation was used in 171 (77.7%) of the patients, 155 (70.5%) with invasive modes and 65 (29.5%) noninvasively; 49 (75.3%) of the patients having noninvasive modes of ventilation subsequently required invasive ventilation. All patients received antiviral therapy. Oseltamivir administration delay after illness onset did not differ between early corticosteroid uses. ARDS was present in 74.3% patients.

1302,204289,"We thank Minervini et al. and Shakiba et al. for their letters in response to our recent study. 1 We concur with Minervini and colleagues that comparison with comorbidity and age-matched, COVID-19 negative controls should have strengthened the scientific merit of the research. However, during the period of the research the participating hospitals performed approximately 15000 elective surgeries. Due to the lack of recognition of the disease at a very early stage of the pandemic, some patients with potential infection were unintentionally scheduled for elective surgeries. And, it is not that suitable for us to retrospectively pick up (difficult to be randomly) some COVID-19 negative controls. So, our initial goal was to report the clinical characteristics and outcomes of the patients. Nevertheless, our conclusion that surgery during incubation period of COVID-19 increases mortality should be generalizable. This can be strengthened by Shakiba and Irani's mention that the mortality rate for surgical patients with ASA-II was between 0.3-1.4%, and 1.8-4.5%"

This study is based on the China CDC dataset and is limited to the variables that are reported to the CDC. We cannot assume children in the United States will be affected similarly. Overall, this dataset suggests that critical disease is rare in children with COVID-19. Emergency physicians should use caution with infants and young children, however, as they appear to be at highest risk of severe disease and may need closer observation in the emergency department or inpatient admission. Presenting symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) typically include fever, dyspnea, myalgia, and cough. Previous data suggest that older adults tend to have more severe illness. This study reports characteristics of and potential risk factors for patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or who died as a result of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19."
1304,2239264,"In fact, at least three genotypes of ORF8 have been found to circulate in nature (Wu et al., 2016) . Type I is genetically closest to ORF8 of civet SARSr-CoV (96.2-98.1% nt identity). There are eleven such strains isolated from bats so far, with eight of them originating from Chinese horseshoe bats and three from greater horseshoe bats. Type II ORF8 has lower (70.8-82.8%) nt identity to ORF8 of civet SARSr-CoV. It is prevalent only in SARSr-Rf-BatCoV and demonstrates genetic stability regardless of geographical distribution with similar ORF8s detected in Korea, Shanxi, Hubei, and Hebei. SARSr-Rs-BatCoV has not been found to process type II ORF8. Yet another strain, the SARSr-Rp-BatCoV F46 isolated from least horseshoe bats, processes an ORF8 with a phylogenetic position right between type I and type II ORF8s with 93.2% nt identity to civet SARSr-CoV, further complicating the analysis (Fig. 6) . The rest of the ORF8 genes from sequenced SARSr-BatCoV strains belong to type III. These type III ORF8 genes possess 53.9-57.7% Fig. 4 .

They are detected across a wide range of bat species including R. sinicus, R. macrotis, R. pusillus, R. affinis, A. stoliczkanus and C. plicata, except R. ferrumequinum in which type III ORF8 has not been found. In short, the ORF8 of SARSr-Rf-BatCoV from greater horseshoe bats is phylogenetically closer to ORF8 of human/civet SARS-CoV. As mentioned above, ORF8 in the late-phase human epidemic was split into 8a and 8b due to a unique 29 nt deletion. A similar 5-nt deletion was observed in the type I ORF8 isolated from the strain SARSr-Rs-BatCoV Rs4084. However, since the majority of SARSr-Rs-BatCoVs' ORF8 genes belong to the type III ORF8 genotype, it raises the speculation that this minority of type I ORF8 plays a non-essential role in the Chinese horseshoe bats host environment."

1306,2970417,"The primers and Taqman probes for HBoV real-time PCR were designed using Bioedit 7.0.5.3 [Hall, 1999] and Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied Biosystems Pty. Ltd., Scoresby, Australia). Briefly, Bioedit software was used to screen full length and partial genome sequences obtained from Genbank in order to identify highly conserved regions. Genbank accession numbers used were: AB248271-2, AB257721-2, AM689298, DQ000496, DQ677523, DQ457414, DQ494200-4, DQ471802-11, DQ499604, DQ267761-75, DQ513330-1, DQ344465-83, DQ340570, and DQ296618-35. Primer Express was then used to investigate the conserved regions and identify primer and probe targets for each gene target selected. Two assays were designed one targeting the Non-structural Protein 1 (NP-1) region and the second targeting the VP-1 (Table I) ."
1307,2659299,"While our past experience with coronaviruses suggests that evolution in animal hosts, both reservoirs and intermediates, is needed to explain the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it cannot be excluded that the virus acquired some of its key mutations during a period of ''cryptic'' spread in humans prior to its first detection in December 2019. Specifically, it is possible that the virus emerged earlier in human populations than envisaged (perhaps not even in Wuhan) but was not detected because asymptomatic infections, those with mild respiratory symptoms, and even sporadic cases of pneumonia were not visible to the standard systems used for surveillance and pathogen identification. During this period of cryptic transmission, the virus could have gradually acquired the key mutations, perhaps including the RBD and furin cleavage site insertions, that enabled it to adapt fully to humans. It wasn't until a cluster of pneumonia cases occurred that we were able to detect COVID-19 via the routine surveillance system. Obviously, retrospective serological or metagenomic studies of respiratory infection will go a long way to determining whether this scenario is correct, although such early cases may never be detected."
1308,2451112,"A zoonotic reservoir harkens back to the emergence of both SARS-and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV, the first highly pathogenic human CoV, emerged in 2002 with transmission from animals to humans occurring in wet markets. Surveillance efforts found SARS-CoV viral RNA in both palm civets and raccoon dogs sold in these wet markets [14] ; however, SARS-CoV was not found in the wild, suggesting that those species served as intermediary reservoir as the virus adapted to more efficiently infect humans. Further surveillance efforts identified highly related CoVs in bat species [15] . More recent work has demonstrated that several bat CoVs are capable of infecting human cells without a need for intermediate adaptation [16, 17] . Additionally, human serology data shows recognition of bat CoV proteins and indicates that low-level zoonotic transmission of SARS-like bat coronaviruses occurs outside of recognized outbreaks [18] . MERS-CoV is also a zoonotic virus with possible origins in bats [19, 20] , although camels are endemically infected and camel contact is frequently reported during primary MERS-CoV cases [21] . For SARS-CoV, strict quarantine and the culling of live markets in SE Asia played a major role in ending the outbreak. With the cultural importance of camels, a similar approach for MERS-CoV was not an option and periodic outbreaks continue in the Middle East. These lessons from SARS and MERS highlight the importance of rapidly finding the source for 2019-nCoV in order to stem the ongoing outbreak."
1309,1271904,"Of the 146 cases of groups A, B and C (abortions and neonates not included since the gender is often not stated) 78% were females, while for the animals with a clinical report (groups A and B, n = 86) the proportion of females was 90%. Animals of five different breeds and diverse crossbreeds were analysed. The majority of cases (n = 146) were of the Swiss Brown (67%), Holstein-Frisian (12%) and Swiss Fleckvieh (11%) breeds. These numbers reflect the over-all breed proportions of the patient population of the clinic. Single cases of Rhä tisches Grauvieh, Dexter, Limousin and beef crossbreeds were also represented. The median age of the animals (n = 146) was 7 months, with a range from 2 days to 6 years. Animals referred to the clinic (groups A and B, n = 86) were significantly older (median = 12 months) than those submitted directly for necropsy (group C, n = 60, median age = 2 months). Of the animals with a clinical record (n = 86), 26% had an age of 24 months or over and four animals were older than 3 years (48, 52, 60 and 72 months). The cases originated from 17 of the 26 Swiss cantons. Most of the cases (n = 146) had a history of recurrent or untreatable diarrhoea (41%), pneumonia (20%) or both conditions together (9%). Neurological symptoms (10%) were often anamnestically described in necropsy reports of young calves, directly referred for postmortem examination (group C). Other anamnestic signs were abortion, lameness due to claw problems, anaemia and ill-thrift. In 45% of the cases (n = 146) the anamnestic report indicated concomitant health problems in the herd.

1311,1239134,"Summary of viruses from bats -More than 200 viruses have been isolated from or detected in bats. Represented are bats of both suborders, 11 families and 37 genera (Table II, Supplementary Table II ). The viruses are representatives of 27 virus families, which is a remarkable diversity (Calisher 2015) . This suggests that viruses detected in bats are unlikely to be there by chance, simply a series of oddities. Indeed, when concerted efforts have been made to search for viruses of specific families, such as coronaviruses (CoVs) and herpesviruses, a large number of these viruses were detected and a substantial proportion of them have been shown to be previously unrecognised viruses or viral subtypes. Because some investigators search only for particular viruses or for viruses of particular families it is certain that many viruses must have been overlooked, so that the lists in the Table II and Supplementary Table II surely underrepresent the actual situation in nature. (2015); b: many of the viruses listed in this Table were first isolated from sources other than bats. The bat hosts listed here are those from which these viruses were first obtained or otherwise detected. Note that certain of the viral nucleic acid sequences detected have been identified to virus family or to genus, but not to species, thus this is a provisional list; c: vernacular names of bats follow primarily Wilson and Reeder (2005) . Some of these viruses or sequences have now been detected in bats of other species."

The models used in the univariate analysis were tested by Likelihood ratio test, Wald test and Score (log-rank) test. Multivariate Cox regressions were subsequently performed for comorbidities and complications, in which the ""Age"" factor was added to correct the models and only variables with statistical significance in univariate analysis were included. All significance levels were computed for 2-tailed testing and the cutoff of significance was set at P < 0.05."
1313,1014169,"Since the COVID-19 has been recently discovered, little immunological information is available. Preliminary studies based on phylogenetic analyses of the COVID-19 whole genome have suggested that this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV (79.7% Identify) (9, 14) . Given the apparent similarity between the two viruses, it could be concluded that previous studies on the protective immune responses against SARS-CoV may be useful for developing a vaccine for COVID-19. Previous studies have suggested that both humoral and cellular immunity play important roles in protective responses against this virus (Deming et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2004) . Studies revealed that the formation of antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV, an immunogenic protein that is highly expressed during infection, is relatively common in patients infected with this virus (Liu et al., 2004; Lin et al., 2003) . Although these antibodies are effective, they have a shorter lifespan in recovering the patients. In addition to the specific humoral immunity, it has been shown that the CD 4þ and CD 8þ responses provide long-lasting protection against COVID-19. These studies showed that besides antibody-mediated immune response, cellular immunity is critical to induce protectivity in these infections (Liu et al., 2017) . The concept of a multi-epitope vaccine is to efficiently identify and assemble B and T-cell epitopes that are more capable of stimulating the immune system and therefore can induce more potent and effective both arms of immune responses. Peptides and epitopes have shown to be desirable candidates for vaccine development due to their relatively easy production, chemical stability, and lack of infectious potential (Patronov & Doytchinova, 2013) . The experimental design and production of multi-epitope vaccines have improved dramatically in recent years. These vaccines are mainly made up of B-cell, CD 8þ cytolytic T-cell (CTLs) and CD 4þ helper T-cells (HTLs) epitopes (Chiarella et al., 2009) . Since the antigenic epitopes of a protein could be predicted and detected, therefore the whole protein is not suitable to stimulate an immune response (Testa & Philip, 2012; Zheng et al., 2017) . During the development of a vaccine candidate against COVID-19, complex pathogenic mechanisms and numerous pathogenic factors should be considered in vaccine formulation."
1314,533065,"The order Nidovirales comprises several clades of distantly related enveloped +RNA viruses, including the arteri-and coronavirus families, which infect a wide variety of hosts, ranging from invertebrates to humans. Human coronaviruses are associated with respiratory disease (including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), reviewed in [2] ) and arteriviruses like porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) are important veterinary pathogens. Members of the nidovirus order are characterized by their exceptional genetic complexity, and the group includes the virus families with the largest RNA genomes described to date (25-32 kb) . Nidoviruses share important traits in their genome organization and gene expression mechanisms, and their key replicative enzymes are presumed to be evolutionarily related (for a review, see [3] ). Their polycistronic genomes are 59capped, 39-polyadenylated, and the two 59-most open reading frames (ORFs) -ORF1a and ORF1b, encode the viral replicase subunits segregated in two large replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, the expression of the latter controlled by a 21 ribosomal frameshift (Fig. 1A) . Autoproteolytic processing of these precursors generates between 13 and 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that direct viral RNA synthesis. Besides genome replication, arteri-and coronavirus RdRp-containing complexes also mediate the synthesis of a distinctive nested set of sg mRNAs that are both 59-and 39coterminal with the viral genome and hence consist of sequences that are noncontiguous in the genomic RNA (Fig. 1B) ."

1316,2046629,"Currently, 1.3 million US Americans reside in nursing homes. One in ten of >1'300 accredited nursing facilities reported COVID-19 cases. An epidemiological survey in such a facility demonstrated the extent of the problem: the first infection in this nursing home was introduced by a symptomatic nurse, and then a week later the first resident tested positive. A further 5 days later, half of the residents from this unit tested positive for viral RNA. During the following 2 weeks, 30 to70% of the residents in other units of this home became infected, along with 19% of the staff. Notably, more than half of the residents were asymptomatic when they tested positive for viral RNA. Four days later, 89% of them had developed symptoms. The rest remained asymptomatic. Mortality was high at 26%. Importantly, asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and symptomatic residents did not differ with respect to viral load and infectious virus release. All viruses showed identical genome sequences"
1317,1615892,"Using this assay, we detected mRNA in about 93% of EDTA blood samples from confirmed FIP cases. In the genomic RNA PCR, 78-92% of FIP cats were found to test positive (Gamble et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995) . More importantly, of the healthy cats living in catteries or multiple cat households with a notoriously large virus burden, only 5% tested positive for FCoV. The presence of FCoV RNA in blood monocytes in healthy cats infected with FCoV is an indication that the development of FIP is not associated with the capability of an FCoV to cause viraemia and systemic infection (Meli et al., 2004) Previous studies quote figures between 20 and 40% (Gamble et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Herrewegh et al., 1995) , which can be expected in view of the high sensitivity of the PCR. The specificity of our test format would therefore appear as a significant improvement over previously published methods. The question remains if the mRNA positive, healthy cats harbour virulent mutants in an early stage of FIP pathogenesis. Quantitative analyses of FCoV mRNA levels would be needed to identify potential differences between healthy and diseased cats."

1319,3034795,"Background: Computational models play an increasingly important role in the assessment and control of public health crises, as demonstrated during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Much research has been done in recent years in the development of sophisticated data-driven models for realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease spreading. However, only a few computational tools are presently available for assessing scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of users including policy makers and health institutions. Results: We present ""GLEaMviz"", a publicly available software system that simulates the spread of emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components: the client application, the proxy middleware, and the simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease compartmental model and configuring the simulation scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters including: compartment-specific features, transition values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The software is designed as a client-server system. The multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user's local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements for large computational capabilities on the user side. Conclusions: The user-friendly graphical interface of the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating the use and exploitation of computational models for the policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks."
1320,1974869,"The primary analysis was a multivariate logistic regression analysis that examined the association between ribavirin use and adverse events, adjusting for factors predictive of severe SARS and corticosteroid use. The predictors included in the model were age, comorbidity, oxygen saturation, chest radiographic findings, absolute neutrophil count, and lactate dehydrogenase level, measured on admission. These factors are associated with progressive respiratory failure, the need for mechanical ventilation, and death from SARS. 17, 19, [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values for the predictive factors in the model, as this approach has been shown to be more powerful and less biased than excluding from the analysis all patients with one or more missing predictors. [40] [41] [42] Because we tested five hypotheses in our primary analysis (i.e., the association of ribavirin with each of five adverse events), to maintain an ␣ of 0.05, we used the Bonferroni correction to lower the p value threshold for statistical significance from 0.05 to 0.01. Confidence intervals (CIs) were also adjusted from 95% to 99%. This approach minimizes the risk of identifying a chance association due to multiple-hypotheses testing. 43"

1323,2905151,"Infection of susceptible mice with MHV results in an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease with many clinical and histologic similarities to the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Lane and Buchmeier, 1997a) . NOS2 is expressed during both the acute and chronic disease stages of MHV infection suggesting a role for NOS2-derived NO in the pathogenesis of disease (Sun et al, 1995; Grzybicki et al, 1997; Lane et al, 1997b Lane et al, , 1999 . A recent study demonstrated that administration of aminoguanidine (AG), a relatively selective inhibitor of NOS2 activity, to MHV-infected mice resulted in reduced demyelination early following infection. However, demyelination was not affected at later time postinfection in AG-treated mice, suggesting a transient role for NO in myelin destruction (Lane et al, 1999) . The current study utilizes mice with a homozygous deletion in the nos2 gene (NOS2 ¡=¡ ) to further characterize the contributions of NOS2-generated NO in MHV-induced CNS disease. The studies presented demonstrate no signi cant differences in the severity of demyelination between MHV-infected NOS2 ¡=¡ mice and NOS2 C=C mice. However, MHV-infected NOS2 ¡=¡ mice displayed a marked decrease in mortality that correlated with a signi cant reduction ( P · 0.001) in numbers of apoptotic neurons within the CNS as compared to infected NOS2 C=C mice. Collectively, these data suggest that NOS2-generated NO contributes to acute neurologic disease by inducing apoptosis of neurons but does not have a role in demyelination."
1324,3052846,"Nidovirus subgenomic mRNAs contain a leader sequence derived from the 5¢ end of the genome fused to different sequences (`bodies') derived from the 3¢ end. Their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis that resembles copy-choice RNA recombination. During this process, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at both template sites and ensure the ®delity of strand transfer. Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS ful®ls multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader±body junctions of TRS mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis."
1325,3061156,"Background: Transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among health care workers (HCWs) and patients has been documented with mortality rate approximating 36%. We propose advanced infection control measures (A-IC) used in conjunction with basic infection control measures (B-IC) help reduce pathogen transmission. B-IC include standard and transmission-based precautions. A-IC are initiatives implemented within our center to enhance effectiveness of B-IC. Objective: Study effectiveness of combining B-IC and A-IC to prevent transmission of MERS-CoV to HCWs. Methods: A retrospective observational study was undertaken. A-IC measures include administrative support with daily rounds; infection control risk assessment; timely screening, isolation, and specimen analysis; collaboration; epidemic planning; stockpiling; implementation of contingency plans; full personal protective equipment use for advanced airway management; use of a real-time electronic isolation flagging system; infection prevention and control team on-call protocols; pretransfer MERS-CoV testing; and education. Results: A total of 874 real-time polymerase chain reaction MERS-CoV tests were performed during the period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending January 31, 2015. Six hundred ninety-four non-HCWs were tested, of these 16 tested positive for MERS-CoV and their infection was community acquired. Sixtynine percent of the confirmed MERS-CoV-positive cases were men, with an average age of 56 years (range, 19-84 years). Of the total tested for MERS-CoV, 180 individuals were HCWs with zero positivity. Conclusions: Adhering to a combination of B-IC and A-IC reduces the risk of MERS-CoV transmission to HCWs."

1328,1996693,"At this time, the improvement of face mask use among pilgrims is a major challenge. In fact, there appears to be a discrepancy between willingness, perceived compliance and actual compliance of pilgrims with respect to face mask use. While several studies showed that face mask use is highly accepted by pilgrims providing that educational intervention is implemented, such intervention is impractical in the context of the Hajj. Various reasons may partially explain the low compliance of face mask usage. First, the stifling heat (in Mecca during October, the average temperature is >38 C during the day and >25 C at night) makes conditions worse and the continuous wearing of masks more difficult to achieve, especially for elderly pilgrims. In addition, pilgrims must carry out the ritual washing (which involves washing the face with water) before each of the five obligatory prayers, forcing them to remove their masks several times per day. Finally, due to the overcrowded conditions in the tent camps where pilgrims spend most of their time during the 5-day period of the Hajj, they are encouraged to take minimum personal belongings with them in a small bag, making it much more difficult for them to transport a large number of disposable face masks. However, in addition to compliance, an important issue is whether masks are being worn correctly by the pilgrims. The effectiveness of face masks in preventing the transmission of influenza and ARIs is dependent on various factors, including setting and compliance. Thus, the role of face mask use has been advocated in a number of studies conducted in multiple settings, including health care facilities, household contacts of index case patients, and university residents. Although most studies have found that the use of masks was associated with a reduced risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome, none of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask use and protection against influenza infection [42, 43] . Moreover, metadata from these studies indicated that wearing surgical masks did not change the frequency of laboratoryconfirmed influenza [44] . As the effectiveness of face masks is likely linked to early, consistent and correct usage, we continue to recommend their use, although available studies do not provide strong evidence for their effectiveness in the prevention of the viral respiratory infection known as ""Hajj cough"". Some actions that may be taken to improve compliance with face mask use are the launch of recall campaigns during the Hajj to inform pilgrims of the importance of face mask and how to use it properly, and free mask distribution to pilgrims, particularly during their stay in Mina."

1331,2035527,"Because of the limitations outlined above, there remains controversy in the causal link between HBoV1 and respiratory disease. A number of studies have correlated HBoV1 detection and the common cold, asthma, acute wheezing, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, acute otitis media and plastic bronchitis. The strongest link in the available literature is that HBoV1 may be the cause of wheezing and pneumonia. One study found a link between HBoV1 DNA in serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or stool and Kawasaki disease, 287 although this study was not confirmed by two other groups. 278, 288 Management No comparative studies of available antivirals have been conducted in patients with HBoV infection. Supportive measures are the only currently available therapy. 275 References available online at expertconsult.com. the upper airway. Severe, sometimes fatal infections, often involving the lower airway, have been described in adults and children with malignancy, hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation. The severity of illness is likely related to reduced cellular immune responses. Likewise, elderly adults, adults with severe cardiopulmonary disease, and residents of long-term care facilities have a higher incidence of hMPV infection with an increased risk of lower airway involvement, complications including bacterial superinfections, and death. 248 Although asymptomatic infection is common for otherwise healthy adults, such individuals may present with cold-and influenzalike illnesses. 267 Adults commonly present with cough, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, but rarely have fever. 130 The role of hMPV in exacerbations of COPD is unclear as one large study demonstrated an association whereas another failed to identify hMPV in patients with COPD exacerbations. 268, 269 Management Generally, patients can be safely managed with supportive care, including supplemental oxygen and intravenous hydration when indicated. Bronchodilators and corticosteroids are often used empirically although there are no controlled trials of these medications for hMPV. 248 Ribavirin shows equivalent activity against hMPV (mean EC50 74µM) and RSV (mean EC50 88 µM). 270 Likewise, standard IgIV has neutralizing antibodies against hMPV (10 log 2 /0.05mL) and RSV (11 log 2 /0.05mL), whereas RSV-specific monoclonal antibodies have no activity against hMPV. 270 Neither agent has been studied prospectively for the treatment of hMPV, although there are a number of case series demonstrating clinical response in some cases. 135, [271] [272] [273] Human Bocavirus Nature Human bocaviruses were first identified through molecular screening in 2005. 274 Bocaviruses are non-enveloped, linear, single-stranded DNA viruses that are members of the Parvoviridae family. 275 There are currently four species of human bocaviruses (HBoV1-4); HBoV2 can be further divided into two strains (A and B). 276 The viral genome encodes two forms of the nonstructural protein (NS1), nuclear phosphoprotein (NP1) and two major structural proteins (VP1 and VP2). 275, 277 Epidemiology Human bocaviruses have been detected worldwide from respiratory and stool specimens. HBoV1 is predominantly a respiratory pathogen whereas HBoV2-4 have been mostly found in stool and are less clearly associated with respiratory tract infections. Although HBoV1 is most commonly detected in children 6-24 months old, it has been detected less frequently in other age groups. 275 Infection appears to occur year round with peaks of detection in the winter and spring. Although HBoV2-4 are felt to be predominantly gastrointestinal viruses, HBoV2 has been detected in nasopharyngeal specimens. 278, 279 Most children have antibodies to HBoV1 by age 6 and most adults have detectable HBoV1 antibodies. 275 "
1332,1449344,"Recently, LSECtin (liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C-type lectin), a lectin which is coexpressed with DC-SIGNR on sinusoidal endothelial cells in liver and lymph node has been identified . The LSECtin gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3 in the vicinity of the genes encoding DC-SIGN/R and CD23 . Sequence analysis revealed that LSECtin harbors all invariant and most of the highly conserved amino acid residues characteristic for C-type lectins . The carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of LSECtin exhibits 39% and 38% amino acid sequence identity with the respective domains of DC-SIGN/R and was shown to interact with various carbohydrates, including mannose, Nacetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), and fucose . However, the ligand(s) of this lectin are unknown."
1333,1209274,"Acute exacerbation of IPF is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with IPF. We suggest that AEx of IPF represents an acute acceleration of the fi broproliferative process (i.e., the underlying pathobiology of IPF) that is triggered by some generally occult stress or insult to the lung (e.g., infection, aspiration, mechanical stretch from ventilation or lavage, high inspired oxygen concentration during surgery). As many patients with AEx of IPF will not meet the current consensus criteria due to missing data, it may be more useful clinically to defi ne AEx by less stringent criteria. It seems likely that the prevention and treatment of AEx of IPF must focus on both disease-specifi c (e.g., anti-fi brotic therapies) and non-disease-specifi c (e.g., vaccination, prevention of stress) areas. The next decade will hopefully answer many of the unresolved questions concerning AEx of IPF."
1334,815037,"Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) are characterised by an overexuberant inflammatory response and, for SARS, viral load is not correlated with the worsening of symptoms. 1,2 In our previous Correspondence to The Lancet, 3 we described how BenevolentAI's proprietary artificial intelligence (AI)-derived knowledge graph, 4 queried by a suite of algorithms, enabled identification of a target and a potential therapeutic against SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the causative organism in COVID-19). We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family-including AAK1 and GAK-the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro. 5, 6 Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrinmediated endocytosis. We suggested that this drug could be of use in countering SARS-CoV-2 infections, subject to appropriate clinical testing."
1335,1047609,"Second, the fundamental pathophysiology of severe viral pneumonia is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 2 Non-invasive ventilation is not recommended for patients with viral infections complicated by pneumonia because, although non-invasive ventilation temporarily improves oxygenation and reduces the work of breathing in these patients, this method does not necessarily change the natural disease course. 6 Finally, the application of noninvasive ventilation in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU is controversial. Considering the above factors, clinicians might not use non-invasive ventilation for critically ill patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 until further data from the COVID-19 epidemic are available. "
1336,1691971,"Many Pol II-transcribed RNAs are translated. Association with components of the translation apparatus has been shown or proposed to be a determinant of selective mRNA targeting by other host-shutoff RNases, such as HSV-1 vhs [30, 31] and KSHV SOX [29] . Moreover, SARS nsp1 requires active translation of RNAs for degradation [22] . To investigate the relationship between translation and RNA targeting by PA-X, we employed a Pol II-driven reporter that is not translated (S2A Fig) due to the insertion of a hairpin close the 5' cap (hp-GFP). This reporter mRNA associates with the translation initiation machinery, but cannot be translated because the hairpin blocks ribosome association and/or scanning [39] . We observed that PA-X decreased the levels of the hp-GFP and a control GFP mRNAs to a similar extent, suggesting that targeting is independent of mRNA translation (Fig 3A) . Conversely we used a dual-construct T7 polymerase system to direct transcription of luciferase RNA by overexpressed T7 polymerase [40] , rather than cellular Pol II. The T7-synthesized luciferase RNA is actively translated HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with GFP-SLII constructs and PA-X, SOX, or empty vector (""-""). Total cellular RNA was extracted and northern blotted using probes against the 3'UTR of the GFP reporter or against 18S (as a loading control). Arrowheads indicate RNA fragments protected from degradation by the SLII sequence. (C-E) HEK 293T shXrn1 or shNS cells were treated with doxycycline (+dox) for four days to induce shRNAs against Xrn1 or non-specific control shRNAs (shNS), or were left untreated (-dox). Three days after shRNA induction, cells were transfected with a GFP reporter plasmid and the indicated construct or empty vector (""-""). Total cellular RNA was extracted and subjected to northern blot analysis or RT-qPCR. (C) GFP mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and normalized against levels of 18S rRNA (also detected by RT-qPCR). Normalized GFP expression is plotted as fold change in PA-X-expressing vs. vector-transfected cells. * = p value (one-sample t-test) < 0.05. (D) Northern blot probes directed against the 3'UTR of the GFP reporter or 18S (as a loading control) were used to detect RNA levels. The bracket denotes PA-X degradation fragments and the arrowhead indicates the RNA fragment generated by SOX cleavage. A representative image is shown. (E) Levels of Xrn1 for experiment in panel D were assessed by western blot, using tubulin as a loading control. This western blot is also representative of the Xrn1 knock-down observed in samples used for panel C and other repeats of the northern blot. Fig 3B) . These results indicate that synthesis by RNA Pol II, rather than translatability of the RNA, is a major determinant for targeting by PA-X."
1337,143547,"A region of the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 35 gamma CoVs were amplified and sequenced, contributing the largest number of sequences from a single wild bird species and location to date. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all viruses sequenced were gammaCoVs. Overall, the sequences were closely related to those from waterfowl in Hong Kong (Chu et al., 2011) . Despite low phylogenetic resolution within the avian gammaCoV (due to short branch lengths, polytomies, and low bootstrap support), pairwise distances indicated two main groups of sequences with 95-97% similarity in our dataset. These two clusters contained sequences from viruses isolated during both the first and second peak of prevalence, suggesting the co-circulation of viruses with more than one genetic RdRp lineage (Fig. 5) . Additionally, there were 2 sequences for CoV from Mallards in our study, which did not cluster into the two main groups, and these were 96% (Avian CoV/Anas platyrhynchos/90A74286/133583/22.11.11/Sweden), and 96-98% (Avian CoV/Anas platyrhynchos/90A88528/ 131643/24.10.11/Sweden) similar to the other main clades (Fig. 5 and Table A .2)."

The estimated incidence in China is then given bypn. With an ad-hoc assumption that the data are generated following the binomial sampling process among travelers from Wuhan, the cumulative incidence is then estimated using a maximum likelihood method. Table 1 also shows the estimated incidence in China. The first exportation event in Thailand suggests 423 cases with the upper confidence limit of 1863 cases. The estimated cumulative incidence has grown as additional cases have been reported. As of 24 January 2020, with reports of thirteen exportation events, the cumulative incidence in China is estimated at 5502 cases (95% confidence interval: 3027, 9057)."

1341,1687481,"Viral infections are initiated by binding of the virus to cellular receptors. In many instances the virus-receptor recognition is highly specific, conferring species specificity and/or tissue specificity. Coronaviruses, which belong to the order of Nidovirales, infect different animal species. They are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded plus-sense RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases. Their genome is characterized by a 5 -terminal cap structure and a 3 poly A tract. The coronaviridae are divided into the toroviruses and the coronaviruses. The coronavirus genus is divided into three serogroups [1] . Most recently novel human coronaviruses were identified during the search on the etiological agent causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [2] [3] [4] [5] . SARS-CoV is an early split off of group 2 coronaviruses [6] , HCoV-NL63 belongs to group 1 [7] , and CoV-HKU I is a group 2 coronavirus [8] . Mouse hepatitis viruses (MHV) belong to group 2, together with rat coronaviruses, puffinosis coronavirus, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV OC43), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV). A major characteristic of group 2 coronaviruses is the presence of a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) surface glycoprotein in addition to the viral spike protein. It was previously demonstrated [9] that the HE protein of the MHV strain S is a sialate-4-Oacetylesterase, which is able to de-O-acetylate Neu4,5Ac 2 . In addition to this strain, puffinosis coronavirus and sialodacryoadenitis virus exhibit a similar substrate specificity [10] [11] [12] . The HE proteins of group 2 coronaviruses interact either with Neu4,5Ac 2 or sialic acids with O-acetylation at position 9 (Neu5,9Ac 2 ). While human coronaviruses related to the reference strain HCoV OC43 and BCoV specifically interact with Neu5,9Ac 2 via the HE [13, 14] and the spike glycoprotein [15] , the murine coronavirus strains S and JHM recognize Neu4,5Ac 2 [9] and a cellular glycoprotein termed MHV-receptor or CEACAM 1a [16] [17] [18] [19] . For Influenza C viruses and BCoV it was shown that they utilize Neu5,9Ac 2 as receptor determinant, which may be part of glycoproteins or the sialic-acid-containing gangliosides [14, 20] . Although it is known that MHV-like coronaviruses bind and hydrolyse either Neu4,5Ac 2 or Neu5,9Ac 2 [9, 21] , the significance for infections by murine coronaviruses remained unclear."
1342,1048223,"Because more CoV strains are available in GenBank for partial genomic sequences, we performed extensive BLAST searches (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) and identified several additional European bat CoV sequences sharing higher nucleotide sequence similarity (82.0%-87.7%) with the novel human betaCoVs. Because only partial RdRp sequences were available for these European bat CoVs, another ML phylogeny was constructed from this short region to examine their evolutionary relationships (Figure 3 , panel G, Appendix). As noted, P.pipi/VM314/2008/NLD (GenBank accession no. GQ259977) identified in a Pipistrellus pipistrellus bat from the Netherlands (18) shows the closest sequence similarity (87.7%) and phylogenetic relationship to the novel human betaCoVs. In addition, 2 CoV sequences, H.sav/J/Spain/2007 (GenBank accession no. HQ184059; from Hypsugo savii, also known as P. savii) and E.isa/M/Spain/2007 (HQ184062; from Eptesicus isabellinus), obtained from bats from Spain (19) are also closely related to the novel human betaCoVs (Figure 3 , panel G, Appendix)."
1343,923680,"Attention is starting to be paid to the emergence of neuropsychiatric presentations of the disorder, including acute encephalopathy. It is estimated that more than one-third of patients with COVID-19 develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, including headache, paresthesia, and disturbed consciousness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms seem to be associated with more severe disease (Mao et al., 2020) . In a recent case series of 58 patients, 49 (84%) developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, including 40 (69%) with agitation, 26 (65%) with positive findings on the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) scale, and 14 (36%) with dysexecutive syndrome (Helms et al., 2020) . It is also known that up to 88% of patients develop anosmia or ageusia, thought to be secondary to invasion of the olfactory bulb by the virus, suggesting brain involvement (Lechien et al., 2020) . Coagulopathies leading to acute cerebrovascular disease are a known complication of ARDS-related disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Guillain-Barre syndrome has been described as a complication (Sedaghat & Karimi, 2020) , and a case report has also highlighted an acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (AHNE) resulting from infection with COVID-19, thought to be possibly related to cytokine storm (Poyiadji et al., 2020) . In addition to these specific pathologies, a case series from Wuhan demonstrated that at least 20% of patients who eventually died from J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f had evidence of encephalopathy . While the preceding accompaniments of the virus may be interpreted as indirect CNS effects, a report from China describes the first case of viral encephalitis with COVID-19, confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (Moriguchi et al., 2020) ."
1344,3079651,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 is spreading in Japan. We have collected a total of 26 patients with COVID-19 who required extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO). The available data from the first 14 cases demonstrated that the median age of patients was 71 and the median PaO 2 /FIO 2 ratio, positive end-expiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, and lung compliance were 70, 15 cmH 2 O, 21 cmH 2 O, and 28 mL/cmH 2 O, respectively. Median serum KL-6 level was 333 U/mL. Consequently, 16 (62%) out of the 26 have been weaned off and 6 (26%) have been extubated and on rehabilitation, while the other 10 (38%) remain on ECMO. There seemed to be two phenotypes of COVID-19: one with impaired lung compliance and one with preserved lung compliance. The latter phenotype was likely to be favored from the use of ECMO. Further investigation is necessary to clasrify the optimal use of ECMO in patients with COVID-19."
1345,1844338,"Alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein, also called human fetuin, belongs to the cystatin superfamily of protease inhibitors involved in important functions such as inhibition of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and regulation of calcium metabolism and osteogenesis [21] . Human fetuin has been demonstrated to be a negative APP in man, and its circulating levels in adults fall significantly during injury and infection [11] . However, we found that it was up-regulated in the SARS patients, which has also been reported by Chen et al. [22] . This could be explained by its role as an immunomodulator. Fetuin influences the resolution of inflammation through enhancing the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages [23] , and antagonizing the deleterious accumulation in lungs, which may cause tissue fibrosis or autoimmunity. Fetuin also opsonizes cationic macrophage-deactivating molecules and suppresses the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) from stimulated macrophages to control the magnitude of the inflammatory response, suggesting a positive role in the recovery phase of acute inflammatory responses [24, 25] ."

A novel betacoronavirus was isolated from one of two patients in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and termed hCoV-EMC (also named hCoV-EMC/2012) (10, 20) . Another case originating from Qatar was transferred to London, United Kingdom, for treatment (18, 19) . Very recently, a third case was reported from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, suggesting that more cases are to be expected (21) . Availability of a virus isolate enables rapid provisional assessments of virus properties in order to guess at virus origins and project epidemic risks.

This produces a unique window of opportunity for innovating in the online conference space (Gichora et al., 2010; Abbott, 2020; Rolnick, 2019) . Thanks to the current huge increase in attention, ongoing innovation in the virtual space is likely to dramatically improve online conferences, potentially making them a better overall experience than legacy conferences."
1349,1755842,"From September 1998 to June 1999, an outbreak of encephalitis occurred amongst pig-farmers in Malaysia. The aetiology of the disease is a novel paramyxovirus name Nipah virus isolated from [79, 80] . The outbreak in humans was preceded by sudden and massive deaths of the pigs due to acute respiratory distress syndrome and encephalitis, and close contacts with pigs was confirmed to be the major risk factor for acquisition of the infection in a case-control study [80] . The presence of the virus in the respiratory secretions and urine of infected pigs suggested that contact with these secretions is the likely route of transmission. About 8% of the patients did not have a contact history with sick pigs; dogs were suspected to be another possible vector for transmission as they can also be infected by Nipah virus. Culling of over 1 million pigs was needed to terminate the outbreak. Singapore was concurrently hit by an outbreak of Nipah encephalitis in March 1999 which affected 11 abbatoir workers who handled pigs imported from Malaysia [81] . Contact with live pigs was again confirmed to be a major risk factor for infection [82] . No interpersonal or nosocomial transmission of Nipah virus infection was noted in these two outbreaks [83] . A search for the reservoir hosts of Nipah virus found that in addition to pigs, wild boars (Sus scrofa), domestic dogs (Canis lupus) and rodents (Rattus rattus) could be secondarily infected. But the main natural reservoir of the virus appears to be flying foxes. Serological studies showed that, in Malaysia, a number of bat species are seropositive, with the majority of the animals belonging to the Megachiroptera [84] . The highest seroprevalence was found in Pteropus hypomelanus (31% seropositive), followed by Pteropus vampyrus (17%), Eonycteris spelaea (5%), Cynopterus brachyotis (4%), and the Microchiropteran Scotophilus kuhlii (3%). Subsequently, Nipah virus was cultured from the urine of the flying fox P. hypomelanus [85] . It was postulated that the combination of anthropogenic deforestation and drought caused by the El Niñ o Southern Oscillation drove the frugivorous flying foxes from their natural habitats into orchard plantations. The close proximity between the bats and pigs thus created, resulted in the cross-species infection of the pigs and subsequently humans [86] ."

1351,2121154,"If UTP binding by NiRAN reflects a genuine property of the enzyme, another mechanism that might utilize its nucleotidylation activity may be protein-primed RNA synthesis. This strategy is used by many viruses including the large group of picornavirus-like viruses, which notably have evolutionary affinity to nidoviruses (35, 36) . In these viruses, a nucleotide is covalently attached to a protein that is commonly known as VPg (viral protein genome-linked), which may then be extended to a dinucleotide. This dinucleotide is subsequently base-paired to the 3 end of the viral RNA where it serves as primer for the synthesis of the complementary RNA strand (106) . Interestingly, the first nucleotide of the EAV genome is a G while the 3 end is equipped with a poly(A) tail. Thus, the dual specificity of nsp9 for GTP and UTP would be compatible with the different requirements for the initiation of the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs of positive and negative polarity, respectively. To which extent this property is conserved across nidoviruses remains to be established."
1352,1980139,"Previous SARS vaccine developments fall into several categories: inactivated SARS-CoV based vaccines [19] [20] [21] , DNA or other recombinant viruses expressing the S spike glycoprotein [10, 11, 22, 47] , subunit vaccines containing S receptor binding domain or soluble ectodomain [23, 24, 52] , and virus like particles (VLPs) based vaccines. Of these, SARS-CoV VLP vaccine candidates have shown considerable promise [30] [31] [32] 48] . Recombinant VLP vaccine development has drawn increasing attention because it has the potential to be safer than inactivated or attenuated viral vaccines and to be more immunogenic than subunit or DNA vaccines [25, 49, 50] . Recently, recombinant influenza VLP vaccines have been reported to be well tolerated and immunogenic in human trials [51] . SARS S proteins have been incorporated into VLPs composed of either M and E, or M and N structural proteins, but were shown to be produced at low levels in mammalian cells [26, 27] . In a baculovirus insect cell expression system, the SARS S proteins were incorporated into secreted and intracellular VLPs composed of SARS M and E [28] [29] [30] [31] , but with low yields. In an effort to address the low yields of SARS-CoV VLPs, chimeric VLPs containing the S from SARS-CoV and M, E, N from mouse hepatitis virus were produced and showed increased yields relative to wild type VLPs when expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, immunization with these VLPs reduced lung virus titer in a mouse challenged model [32] . Although, SARS VLPs formation and its immunogenicity were shown to be promising from these studies, the expression levels remained less than what would be needed for a viable commercial vaccine candidate."

1356,2588090,"By virtue of their profession, doctors and nurses have more stringent obligations of beneficence than most. They have obligations to a specified group of persons (their patients) that nonmedical personnel have no obligation to help. The term ""duty of care"" refers to these special obligations. In its bare form, however, the phrase gives no indication of the precise nature of the duty, nor of its limits. Its definitional vagueness, combined with its rhetorical appeal, may be used to justify actions without the need for rational deliberation. During the SARS outbreaks in Toronto, the phrase was often used as a self-standing argument for active involvement on the part of medical staff, without any critical examination of its meaning. Used in this manner, the term may become a subtle instrument of intimidation, pressuring healthcare workers into working in circumstances that they consider morally, psychologically, or physically unacceptable. The phrase duty of care can thus be ethically dangerous by giving the illusion of legitimate moral justification."

1360,956573,"Equine coronavirus was isolated and characterised only recently in 2000 [26] but described as an infectious agent in sick foals in 1975 [27] . Although this study and those of others have identified coronaviruses in foals with enteric disease, the pathogenicity and its aetiological role in enteric disease have not been examined. The current prevalence study clearly shows that healthy foals without signs of GI disease are equally often infected with equine coronavirus as foals with GI disease and suggests low pathogenicity of ECoV in foals. However, when analysed as coinfecting agent, ECoV was significantly associated with diseased animals: all ECoV infections in the GI-diseased group were associated with coinfections (15 of 15) while foals in the healthy group were mostly monoinfected (8 of 10). This could indicate that pre-existing coronavirus infections facilitate opportunistic secondary infections through neutropenia and lymphopenia of the local immune environment as is known in other species [28] [29] [30] Secondary bacterial and parasitic infections from Gram-negative and anaerobic microflora are described in other species and cause additional complications related to intestinal damage, bacteraemia, toxinaemia and altered mucosal functions [14, 30] . Opportunistic infections can be of different origin, including bacterial or protozoal, as shown in this study. Coinfection studies in piglets indicate that coronavirus and bacterial coinfections have a significant effect on the magnitude of the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage compared with monoinfections [29] . In young turkeys, coronavirus and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) interact synergistically with severe growth depression and high mortality when compared with monoinfected turkeys [30] . Turkeys infected first with coronavirus and then with EPEC developed greater mortality and increased frequency of attaching and effacing lesions than that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPEC prior to turkey coronavirus or simultaneously inoculated with these agents; these observations, although in different species, could suggest an under-recognised role for coronavirus infections in foals. Clearly, additional studies are needed to determine equine coronavirus virulence factors and the relative importance as a coinfecting agent contributing to GI disease in foals."
1361,2862280,"obesity, increased food intake, nutrient/energy imbalance affect in a bidirectional way the immune deficiency, especially in vulnerable populations. Patients with type 2 diabetes and those with metabolic syndrome (pre-diabetes) may be up to ten times more likely to die when they become ill with coVid-19 (9). The mortality rate for young people who had to be admitted to a hospital with severe respiratory illness due to coVid-19 was approximately 2%, but this increased to 14% for the most vulnerable such as coVid-19 patients with obesity and related co-morbidity (97) . For autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis, treatment may include drugs including methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) that suppress the immune system to treat the disease and symptoms making immune-compromised patients more vulnerable to coVid-19 infection (98) ."

This does not support the suggestion by MCI~TOS~ et al.

1363,1630601,"Only one-third of the participants reported that they always wore a face mask when having respiratory symptoms (29.1%). Their practice was considered unsatisfactory. Immediately after the epidemic of SARS in 2003, the people of Hong Kong have developed a consensus on wearing a face mask when having respiratory symptoms [9] . However, this practice revealed a downward Post hoc analysis using the Games-Howell test revealed a significant difference in technique between participants in ""25-34 years old"" and ""55-64 years old"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""25-34 years old"" and ""65-74 years old"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""25-34 years old"" and ""75 years old or above"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""35-44 years old"" and ""55-64 years old"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""35-44 years old"" and ""65-74 years old"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""35-44 years old"" and ""75 years old or above"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""45-54 years old"" and ""55-64 years old"" (p < 0.001), between participants in ""45-54 years old"" and ""65-74 years old"" (p < 0.001), as well as between participants in ""45-54 years old"" and ""75 years old or above"" (p < 0.001) trend over the years. The prevalence of wearing face mask amongst adults with respiratory symptoms was high, with a percentage of 90.0% during the SARS epidemic in 2003 [7] , 92.4% during an anticipated H5N1 epidemic in 2005 [8] and 88.75% during the early phase of the H1N1 influenza epidemic in 2009 [9] . However, the rate was reduced to 39.0% during the pandemic preparation for H7N9 influenza in 2014 [26] and further to 29.1% during a nonepidemic state in 2017 (the present study). The overall decrease in the practice of using face mask over the last decade is possibly related to the decrease in the severity of respiratory infections that occur in Hong Kong. In 2003, around 300 people in Hong Kong died due to the SARS pandemic [27] . In 2014, no death was reported in the H7N9 influenza pandemic [28] . A low fatality rate from a respiratory pandemic likely results in less compliance with preventive measures, such as wearing face masks [11] . Moreover, people may have developed fatigue after exposure to repeated epidemics. In addition, the nature of the health atmosphere might have contributed to the outcome. At the time of the study in Hong Kong, respiratory infection was a generic health topic rather than a focused one. Health education on wearing face masks was generally conducted through pamphlets and videos that were delivered in clinics, hospitals and online platforms. Thus, people tend to hold inactive attitudes and adopt preventive practices less [26] . Our study revealed an alarming finding that the adults' practice of using face mask during a nonepidemic state is unsatisfactory; this issue deserves further attention."

1365,1003022,"Enveloped viruses contain a lipid bilayer that serves as an anchor for viral glycoproteins and protects the nucleocapsid containing the genetic information from the environment. The lipid bilayer is acquired from host cell membranes during the process of virus assembly and budding. Consequently, infection of host cells requires that enveloped viruses fuse their membrane with cellular membranes to release the nucleocapsid and accessory proteins into the host cell in order to establish a new infectious cycle. Glycoproteins from enveloped viruses evolved to combine two main features. Firstly, they contain a receptor binding function, which attaches the virus to the host cell. Secondly, they include a fusion protein function that can be activated to mediate fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Both tasks can be achieved by a single or by separate glycoproteins acting in concert."
1366,1628452,"In addition, endogenous bornavirus-like elements (EBL) have been detected in the genome of several bat species [21] [22] [23] [24] . These EBL are DNA-sequences in bat genomes displaying considerable sequence identities to present-day bornaviral genes on amino acid level of about 30-50% [25] . In some bat species, transcription of EBL similar to the bornaviral RNA-dependent RNApolymerase has been reported [22] . Further analysis of these EBL strongly hint at ancestral and repeated contact between bats and bornaviruses during their evolution at least 11,8 million years ago [23, 26] . The function of these EBL is still discussed and an immunological benefit in the interaction with bornaviruses has been suggested in some mammalian species [22, 27] . As the retaining of the expressed EBL in the bat genome despite evolutionary selection requires resources, a benefit of the EBL and regular encounters between bornaviruses and bats during evolution seem plausible [22] ."

This concurs with the 5% efficiency determined by densitometry for the Newcastle strain of astrovirus serotype 1 [25] and is similar to that reported for RSV [-16] , but is significantly lower than the 20-30% efficiency reported for IBV [4] . It is notable that, construct B, which included the most likely shifty heptamer (nt 2794-2800) but not the upstream potential shifty heptamer (nt 2779-2785), shifted with an efficiency indistinguishable from construct A in which both potential shifty heptamers were included."
1368,508965,"Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of enveloped RNA viruses that infect mammals and birds, causing mainly respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases (Masters and Perlman, 2013) . They have long been studied, in part because of their significant impact on livestock and companion animals. In humans, four coronaviruses, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1, generally cause upper respiratory tract infections and are prevalent worldwide. Of paramount concern to human health, however, are two deadly coronaviruses that emerged just in this century (de Wit et al., 2016) . The first of these, the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), originated in bats. SARS-CoV caused an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in China in late 2002, spread worldwide, and was extinguished by mid-2003 through the rigorous application of public health measures. All told, the SARS epidemic was characterized by high human-to-human transmission and a case-fatality rate of 10%. Although SARS-CoV was eliminated from the human population, very closely related coronaviruses persist in bat reservoirs, posing a constant threat for reemergence. The second most noteworthy human coronavirus is the one responsible for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an outbreak of severe pneumonia that began in Saudi Arabia in 2012. At present, MERS is confined to the Arabian peninsula, from where cases have sporadically dispersed to other parts of the world. Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV has an ancestral origin in bats, but its proximal reservoir is dromedary camels, and transmission from this source in ongoing. In contrast to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV does not spread as efficiently through human-to-human contact; nevertheless, it has an alarming case-fatality rate of 36%. The emergence of these two previously unknown coronaviruses has stimulated efforts to fully understand all aspects of the molecular biology of members of this family."
1369,427591,"Coagulopathy is a common feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and an increase in d-dimer is the most common finding. One of the larger initial studies found abnormally elevated d-dimer levels in 260 of 560 cases (46.4%) with a prevalence of 43% in nonsevere patients compared with 60% in critically ill ICU patients (18) . In another series, elevated d-dimers were associated with a poor prognosis (19) . More recently, Zhang et al (20) examined 343 cases and showed that d-dimer levels of over 2.0 mg/L could predict mortality with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 83.3%. Tang et al (21) reported increased d-dimers and fibrin degradation products along with mildly to moderately increased prothrombin times (PTs) and activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTT) in COVID-19.

1370,1911705,"Binding of S protein of murine coronavirus MHV to a specific soluble or cell surface glycoprotein receptor induces global changes in the conformation of S protein that converts S protein from a native pre-fusogenic state to a fusion active state (Fig. 1 ). In the case of the MHV-JHM strain, interaction with the host cell receptor CEACAM1 causes the S1 domain to readily dissociate from the S1/S2 complex, resulting in display of a new hydrophobic surface area that allows the virions to bind to liposomes and exposes previously hidden trypsin cleavage sites in S2 (21) (22) (23) . This receptor-induced conformational change is believed to facilitate the release of a hydrophobic fusion peptide from the interior of S2 and position it to interact with the host cell membrane. Next, the fusion active state of type 1 viral fusion proteins resolves itself to a fusogenic or post-fusion state (24) . This latter change is thought to arise from an association between the two coiled-coil regions within the S2 subunit, in which the N-terminal HR region from three S proteins forms a parallel triple-stranded coiled coil and the interhelical polypeptide chain loops around to reverse the polypeptide chain direction, positioning the HR-C region antiparallel to HR-N. The residues at the a and d positions (of the heptad repeat positions denoted (abcdefg) n ) of HR-C then pack into grooves formed by the residues at the a, d, e, and g positions of the HR-N core coiled coil to complete the 6-stranded ␣-helical bundle structure also termed ""trimer of hairpins"" or ""trimer of dimers."" This structure ultimately draws the viral and cellular membranes close together, destabilizing the lipid bilayers that surround the virus and target cell, causing fusion and release of the viral nucleocapsid into the host cell. The high resolution structures of the ectodomains of type 1 viral fusion proteins from many enveloped viruses show very similar structures in the fusogenic state, suggesting a general membrane fusion mechanism (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) ."

1373,1452695,"† Changes in host ecology and environment. For example, urbanization has been cited as a key factor increasing the transmission potential of many human viral and bacterial infections [10, 11] , as has the extremely high densities of European wheat and barley crops for diseases such as yellow rust and powdery mildew, respectively [12, 13] . Another example is the ongoing concern that climate change might be associated with changing distributions of vector-borne diseases, such as tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease [14] [15] [16] ; † Changes in host behaviour and movements. For example, patterns of sexual behaviour directly affect the potential spread of sexually transmitted diseases [10, 17] , and global travel exacerbated the spread of SARS [18] ; † Changes in host phenotype. For example, immunosuppression during hospital treatments or due to the effects of HIV/AIDS has been cited as contributing to the spread of numerous infections (e.g. the fungal pathogen Pneumocystis carinii) [10, 11, 17] . The loss of cross-immunity (where acquired immune responses induced by exposure to one microorganism are at least partially protective against infection with another; a quite general concept that, for example, underlies the efficacy of BCG vaccination) might also increase the potential for invasions by new pathogens, as has been suggested for several pairings: yaws and syphilis; leprosy and TB; yellow fever and dengue fever; smallpox and monkeypox; and vivax malaria and falciparum malaria [17, 19, 20] ; † Changes in host genetics. For example, the loss of major histocompatibility complex haplotypes or other genetic diversity in inbred livestock or small populations might increase susceptibility to infection [21] . Among plants, the use of single cultivars increases the vulnerability of many crop species to widespread epidemics of pathogens spilling over from closely related wild host species: for example, commercial banana plantations composed of a single clone are at risk from various races of Panama disease, Fusarium oxysporum [22] ; † Changes in pathogen genetics (discussed in detail below)."
1374,402034,"One of the major challenges encountered during the SARS epidemic was understanding the reasons underlying the variation in case fatality ratios reported for different countries. A large part of this variation could in retrospect be attributed to difficulties in standardizing the definition of a SARS case and in assigning cause of death. In particular, it is clear that comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly increased the case fatality ratio, particularly in the elderly (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) . In addition, a change in the case mix over time (for example, in the age distribution of patients) could be misinterpreted as a change in virulence of the pathogen. Furthermore, using data on hospitalized cases, as presented here, could potentially overestimate the underlying case fatality of infection if individuals with less severe or no symptoms of disease do not present at the hospital. Sensitive and specific serologic tests used among contacts of SARS cases (22) , as well as in the wider community (23), have found very few previously unidentified SARS infections, suggesting that the case fatality ratio per hospital admission, as estimated here, was essentially equivalent to the case fatality ratio per case of infection. However, this may not be true, in fact usually is not, for other epidemics."
1375,565177,"The atypical pneumonia case, caused by a novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), was first reported and confirmed in Wuhan, China in December 31, 2019 (Pneumonia of unknown cause-China,2020) [1] . Initially confined to Wuhan, the infection has spread elsewhere, sporadic cases exported from Wuhan were reported in many foreign countries.On January 30, the WHO Director-General declared that the 2019-nCov outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [2] . So far, the outbreak is still on-going, the number of reported cases of 2019-nCov infection continue to increase.Several relevant literatures estimated the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV, the mean estimate of R0 for the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) ranges from 1.4 to 3.58 [3, 4] . As of 18 February 2020, NCP has caused 73400 confirmed cases including 1870 deaths, 6242 suspected cases, and 12734 cured cases in mainland released by the National Health Commission of China. Now Japan has become the second most affected country with 519 confirmed cases, and followed by Singapore with 77 confirmed cases. Person-to-person transmission of NCP has been confirmed and with several ways of transmission, moreover the asymptomatic individual is identified as a potential source of infection. Fever and cough were reported as main clinical manifestations of NCP patients [5] . Based on the clinical observations and summary, the main diagnostic criteria [6] of 2019-nCov infections are : 1) Contact history of the epidemic area and related patients; 2) Nucleic acid is positive; 3) Fever, cough, shortness of breath and other clinical symptoms; 4) Laboratory examination showed that white blood cells were normal or decreased and lymphocytes decreased; 5) Lung lesions. Especially,the 1th and 2th standards were the most important for 2019-nCov infected confirm. However, in the diagnosis and treatment process, it was found that the above diagnostic criteria could not fully meet the needs of clinical prevention and control, and some atypical clinical manifestations appeared [5, 7, 8] , which brought great difficulties and challenges to the prevention and control of the epidemic."

Power calculations were performed by using PASS 2002 (J. Hintze, NCSS and PASS, Number Cruncher Statistical Systems, Kaysville, Utah). By using a power of 90% and α of 0.05, a sample of 12 patients in each group would be sufficient to support these findings (70% vs. 6.4%). By using the same power calculations, 23 patients in each group would provide adequate power to show as little as a 45% difference in proportions with co-infection between the two groups. Comparisons were made by using the chisquare test and Wilcoxon rank sum tests, as appropriate (Table) . Exact 95% confidence intervals were calculated in SAS V8.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)."
1377,3142687,"Background: A novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus was found to infect three Chinese residents, the first H7N9 infection in humans in Asia. Chest computed tomography (CT) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis is not only expensive but also exposes patients to radiation and might cause patients to be at risk of infection during transportation; in addition, chest radiography cannot be used to monitor the lung repeatedly in real time. Therefore, the routine use of bedside lung ultrasonography for critically ill patients with ARDS is especially valuable. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the application of ultrasound for lung examination in patients with ARDS. Methods: Eleven patients infected with H7N9 avian influenza who developed ARDS were diagnosed by lung ultrasonography. Results: Six patients who had severe ARDS showed a diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score ≥ 7 and a lung ultrasound score ≥ 20 points. A diffuse comet tail sign or a consolidation score ≤ 6 and a lung ultrasound score < 25 were observed in four patients. One patient showed a diffuse comet tail sign or consolidation area in four lung areas, with an ultrasound score of 14. Among all 11 patients studied, 6 patients had thoracic puncture and drainage of pleural effusion and 2 patients had pneumothorax puncture drainage. Conclusions: Lung ultrasound could be useful for monitoring ARDS caused by the influenza virus A H7N9 strain in clinical applications."
1378,1109183,"For entry screening to be successfully employed, substantial resources are required to identify the small fraction of travelers who may have H1N1 infection [16] . Further resources may be needed to isolate identified cases, and trace and quarantine close contacts. An important caveat is that a delay in inevitable local transmission of a pandemic virus may not be desirable if it would defer local transmission into a season associated with higher transmissibility such as the winter in temperate regions [12] , or if it led to importation and local transmission of antiviral resistant strains [17] ."
1379,1366519,"The outbreak of an epidemical pneumonia with initially unknown reasons in December 2019 in Wuhan, China was ultimately found to be caused by a new virus, the ""2019 novel Coronavirus"" (2019-nCoV) or SARS-CoV-2 formally named by the World Committee on Virus Classification, [1] [2] [3] and the disease caused by this virus was named as COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. 4 , 5 This virus has a characteristic crown representing the spike peplomers on the viral envelope, with strong infectivity and general suscepti-bility to people of all ages and across the globe. On the 8th February 2020, the disease was named as ""Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (NCP)"" in China. 6 By February 16, 2020, China had reported a cumulative total of 70,548 patients being infected with SARS-CoV-2, 57,934 cases currently treated (10,644 severe cases), 1770 deaths, 10,844 cases being discharged from hospitals, 7264 suspected cases and 546,016 cases in close contact including 150,539 people being isolated and closely watched. The SARS-CoV-2 is primarily propagated through respiratory droplets and close contact, with the incubation period usually between 1 and 14 days and the typical symptoms after onset of fever, dry cough, fatigue and gradual appearance of dyspnea. People carrying this virus are the source of infection even in the incubation period, and early diagnosis of this disease or carrier of the virus is crucial to preventing it from further spread. However, confirmation of infection of this virus requires presence of the virus nucleic acid detected in swabs, secretions and sputum from the respiratory tract, blood or stools. 7 Nonetheless, detection of the virus nucleic acid may not be convenient, and early diagnosis of the NCP is essential for timely isolation and treatment of the patient. Computed tomography (CT) is easily available and can be used to screen patients for rapid confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP because CT, especially high resolution CT, has the advantages of high spatial resolution, freedom of disturbance from other structures outside the scanning plane and ability to display every details of the lesion in multiple planes and directions. This study was performed to analyze the clinical and CT imaging features in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infected NCP or COVID-19 and to familiarize radiologists and doctors with the common clinical and CT imaging findings of this disease for quick recognition, rapid isolation and treatment of the patient."
1380,3077636,"Ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent active in vitr'o against a number of RNA and DNA viruses, has been associated with moderate toxicity in laboratory animals and humans. Clinically, ribavirin has been used effectively in persons primarily to treat life-threatening viral diseases such as acute haernorrhagic fever o r viral pneumonia of infants. I n order to evaluate the feasibility of using this antiviral agent in cats, the effects of oral ( p a ) , intramuscular (i.ni.) and intravenous (i.v.) doses of ribavirin in 27 9-month-old specific-pathogen-free cats were evaluated by haematology , clinical chemistries, bone marrow biopsies and histopathology. Ribavirin was administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at a dose of either 11, 22, or 44 mg/kg after which all cats were euthanatized and necropsied. Most cats receiving 22 or 44 mg of ribavirinlkg became anorectic and suffered some degree of weight loss (0.2 to 0.6 kg), and about one-third of the cats developed diarrhoea and/or niucous membrane pallor. Icterus or haemorrhage was not observed. T h e most profound and consistent haematologic change, particularly among the moderate and high dosage groups regardless of route of administration, was a significant and severe thrombocytopenia (range, 33-78%, reduction in mean platelet counts vs. baseline). Other changes, particularly reductions in total WBC and neutrophils and reductions in RBC and PCV, tended to occur at lower ribavirin dosages, but generally they were not statistically significant. Cats given 44 mg of ribaviridkg i.v. showed significant decreases in leukocyte variables, including total WBC ( P = 0.016), neutrophils ( P = 0.026) and lymphocytes (P = 0.047). Mild-to-moderate increases in serum alanine aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities occurred at doses of 22 and 44 mg/kg. Evaluation of bone marrow biopsies before and after treatment revealed that cats given 11 mg of ribavirin/kg had mild megakaryocytic (MK) hypoplasia, whereas cats receiving 22 or 44 mg/kg had progressively severe degrees of MK hypoplasia and dysplasia, asynchronous MK maturation, arid increased mye1oid:erythroid ratio. Pathologic changes in ribavirin-treated cats generally were mild and included primarily enteritis (seven cats) and hepatocellular vacuolation and/or centrilobular necrosis (seven cats). Results of this study in cats indicated that daily administration of ribavirin at a dose range of 11 to 44 mg/kg induced a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes and erythroid precursors, and at the higher dosages it suppressed numbers of circulating leukocytes."
1381,3080338,"Background and aims: COVID-19 is already a pandemic. Emerging data suggest an increased association and a heightened mortality in patients of COVID-19 with comorbidities. We aimed to evaluate the outcome in hypertensive patients with COVID-19 and its relation to the use of renin-angiotensin system blockers (RASB). Methods: We have systematically searched the medical database up to March 27, 2020 and retrieved all the published articles in English language related to our topic using MeSH key words. Results: From the pooled data of all ten available Chinese studies (n ¼ 2209) that have reported the characteristics of comorbidities in patients with COVID-19, hypertension was present in nearly 21%, followed by diabetes in nearly 11%, and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) in approximately 7% of patients. Although the emerging data hints to an increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients with known hypertension, diabetes and CVD, it should be noted that it was not adjusted for multiple confounding factors. Harm or benefit in COVID-19 patients receiving RASB has not been typically assessed in these studies yet, although mechanistically and plausibly both, benefit and harm is possible with these agents, given that COVID-19 expresses to tissues through the receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme-2. Conclusion: Special attention is definitely required in patients with COVID-19 with associated comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and established CVD. Although the role of RASB has a mechanistic equipoise, patients with COVID-19 should not stop these drugs at this point of time, as recommended by various world organizations and without the advice of health care provider."

1384,1624564,"In addition to inflammasome activation, cytoplasmic leakage of cathepsins is associated with cell death. Activation of caspase-3 is the hallmark of programmed cell death, apoptosis, and we have previously shown that caspase-3 is activated in human macrophages during influenza A virus infection [5] . To study the role of cathepsin B in influenza A virus-induced activation of apoptosis, macrophages were infected in the presence and absence of cathepsin B inhibitor, Ca-074-Me, and caspase-3 activation was analysed by Western blotting. Like caspase-1, caspase-3 is a latent zymogen, which is processed upon activation into smaller polypeptide chains: p17 and p12, which in turn form the bioactive enzyme. Influenza A virus (Udorn/72) infection clearly activated the formation of caspase-3 p17/p19 (Fig. 4D) . Furthermore, Ca-074-Me inhibited the formation caspase-3 p17/p19 in response to infuenza A viruses Udorn/72 (Fig. 4D) and Beijing 353/89 (Fig.  S3C ) confirming the role of cathepsins in the activation of apoptosis during infection. This effect was not dependent on diminished viral replication since Ca-074-Me treatment had only little effect on influenza A virus protein expression (Fig. 4D )."

1386,2206628,"The initial stage occurs at the time of inoculation and early establishment of disease. For most people, this involves an incubation period associated with mild and often non-specific symptoms such as malaise, fever and a dry cough. During this period, SARS-CoV-2 multiplies and establishes residence in the host, primarily focusing on the respiratory system. Similar to its older relative, SARS-CoV (responsible for the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak), SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on human cells. 8 These receptors are abundantly present on human lung and small intestine epithelium, as well as the vascular endothelium. As a result of the airborne method of transmission as well as affinity for pulmonary ACE2 receptors, the infection usually presents with mild respiratory and systemic symptoms. Diagnosis at this stage includes respiratory sample PCR, serum testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, along with chest imaging, complete blood count (CBC) and liver function tests. CBC may reveal a lymphopenia and neutrophilia without other significant abnormalities. Treatment at this stage is primarily targeted towards symptomatic relief."

It represents the collective opinions and perspectives of thoracic radiology, pulmonology, intensive care, emergency medicine, laboratory medicine, and infection control experts practicing in 10 countries, representative of the highest burden of COVID-19 worldwide. It also represents opinion at a moment in time within a highly-dynamic environment where the status of regional epidemics and the availability of critical resources to combat those epidemics vary daily. The evidence base supporting the use of imaging across the scenarios presented is scant and the advice presented herein may undergo refinement through rigorous scientific investigation, exposing nuances of image interpretation that may lead to prognostic information and guide management decisions. At the time of this writing, no therapy has been confirmed to alter the course of COVID-19, there is no known cure, and there is no vaccine for prevention.

1388,2568209,"major changes include germ cell depletion, presence of Sertoli cell-only pattern, interstitial inflammation, leukocyte infiltration, peritubular fibrosis associated with tubular hyalinization, and thickening of the tubular wall [19] [20] [21] . Orchitis caused by mumps virus mainly develops in adult patients [22] . The virus attacks the testis directly, destroying the testicular parenchyma, causing degeneration of germ cells, exudation of leukocytes, and deposition of collagen [23, 24] . Apart from HIV and mumps virus, other viruses, such as Hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and Papilloma virus, were also reported to cause viral orchitis [9] . SARS is a new disease caused by a novel coronavirus. We report here that the SARS virus causes orchitis. Germ cells must develop at a temperature lower than 378C. Persistent high fever leads to changes in testicular temperature, contributing to germ cell degeneration and destruction. Previous studies reported that high temperature resulted in meiotic germ cell apoptosis [25] . High fever was also thought to play an important role in mumps orchitis [26] . High fever in SARS might have an indirect effect on testicular dysfunction. CD3 (B and D) . A) Testis from the control case C01, showing a few CD68þ macrophages in the interstitial tissue (arrows) and no macrophage in the tubule. B) Testis from the control case C02, showing a few CD3þ T lymphocytes in the interstitial tissue (arrows), and no positive cell in the tubule. C) Testis from SARS patient S08, showing CD68þ macrophages in the seminiferous tubules (arrow heads) and the interstitial tissue (arrows). D) Testis from SARS patient S11, showing CD3þ T lymphocytes in the seminiferous tubules (arrow head) and the interstitial tissue (arrows). E) Negative control without primary antibody on the case C01. Bar ¼ 50 lm. However, temperature might not be the only reason. In the control group, there was a case (C03) with lasting high fever, and this testis demonstrated mild fibrosis and congestion with no obvious germ cell loss or leukocyte infiltration. In addition, the treatment of SARS with steroids could also have affected spermatogenesis. Glucocorticoid had been used in five cases (except S05) and it had been reported to induce rat Leydig cell apoptosis [27] . In this study, we did not find an obvious increase of apoptotic Leydig cell in the six SARS cases (P . 0.05 compared with control). Instead, we found mild Leydig cell hyperplasia in some cases. The testis of case S05, who did not take steroids, also displayed changes of orchitis, as did another five SARS cases. Glucocorticoid should not induce leukocyte infiltration and is routinely used to treat orchitis to suppress inflammation. This indicates that steroid treatment might not be the cause for orchitis in SARS, at least not for case S05. Reports on testicular endocrine function in viral orchitis are rare. Previous studies observed a drop in testosterone level together with an increase in LH and FSH levels in patients suffering from mumps orchitis [28] . Similarly, in some male AIDS cases, low serum testosterone levels associated with high serum LH and FSH levels were also reported [29] . These findings suggest that viruses might act indirectly via changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis. However, there were other studies that found no significant abnormality in sex hormone in male patients with HIV orchitis [14] . The absence of clinical information on the levels of testosterone, LH, or FSH in these SARS patients precludes the possibility of a meaningful clinicopathological correlation."
1389,2312495,"Data acquisition and quantification were also done as previously reported by us [33] . To account for potential batch-to-batch variations, multiple preparations of EBOV RdRp were used during data acquisition for this study. The amount of EBOV RdRp used in the RNA synthesis assay was optimized such that incorporation of [α-32 P]-GTP (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA, USA) would reach its maximum after 30 min. The amount of RSV and h-mtRNAP was optimized to have the similar apparent activity as EBOV RdRp by testing various amounts of enzymes. This involved employing low-micromolar concentrations of NTP substrates in RNA synthesis reactions containing h-mtRNAP. RNA synthesis assay consisted of mixing (final concentrations) Tris-HCl (pH 8, 25 mM), RNA primer (200 µM), RNA template (1 µM), [α-32 P]-GTP (0.1 µM), various concentrations and combinations of NTP and NTP analogues, and EBOV RdRp (1-2 µL) on ice. Note that DNA templates were used in reactions containing h-mtRNAP. The reaction mixtures (10 µL) were incubated for 10 min at 30 • C followed by the addition of 5 µL of MgCl 2 (5 mM). The reactions were stopped after 30 min by the addition of 15 µL of formamide/EDTA (50 mM) mixture and incubated at 95 • C for 10 min.

1390,628545,"There is a certain degree of similarity between 2019-CoV and SARS-CoV. Both of them caused frequent fever, cough, and fatigue, whereas the upper respiratory symptoms like pharyngalgia and rhinorrhea were less common [11, 12] . SARS-CoV targets human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and infects intrapulmonary epithelial cells more than cells of the upper airways [13, 14] . MERS-CoV attaches to its receptor, an exopeptidase called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 to infect its host [15] . It appears that SARS-CoV-2 uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV did [16] , so the replication of SARS-CoV-2 is more likely to happen in the lower respiratory tract rather than the throat. This hypothesis may be the reason for the false negative was also reported in two other researches [5, 18] . Given SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share 75%-80% gene sequence and genomic sequence was detected in the faeces of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 would infect more than just the respiratory system, which may complicate the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 [16] . to the outcomes data of two patients in the SpO2<90% group was missing, the prognosis comparation between the SpO2<90% group and the SpO2≥90% group may be biased.

1391,33919,"IL-18 signaling promotes interferon gamma production at the peak of infection IL-18R −/− mice are highly susceptible to MHV infection, with poor survival (Fig. 2a) and poor control of viral replication (Fig. 2c) . We next sought to determine why the loss of IL-18 signaling leads to this phenotype. IL-18 acts on T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells to promote interferon gamma production (Okamura et al. 1995; Nagarajan and Kronenberg 2007; Bellora et al. 2012; Serti et al. 2014 ) as well as cytotoxicity, often through promoting perforin production (Okamura et al. 1995; Dao et al. 1996; Tsutsui et al. 1996) . Both interferon gamma and perforin-mediated cell killing are important for host defense during MHV infection Bergmann et al. 1999; Martinon et al. 2002; Bergmann et al. 2003; Ramakrishna et al. 2004 ); so, we hypothesized that in the absence of IL-18 signaling, mice develop an immunodeficiency that makes them vulnerable to MHV infection. We began by determining the concentration of interferon gamma in the serum of infected WT and IL-18R −/− mice, hypothesizing that if one or more cell types produce interferon gamma in an IL-18-dependent manner during MHV infection, we might be able to observe a global decrease in interferon gamma production. Mice were infected with 500 PFU of MHV, and 3, 5, and 7 days after infection serum was isolated. Five days after infection, at the peak of interferon gamma production and viral titers, IL-18R −/− mice had significantly lower cytokine concentrations (Fig. 4) , despite slightly higher viral loads in several organs. This suggests that IL-18R −/− mice have a defect in interferon gamma production. By 7 days after infection, higher interferon gamma levels are observed in IL-18R −/− mice, which we speculate to be due to IL-18-independent sources reacting to elevated viral loads in the knockout mice compared to WT mice. This IL-18-independent production of interferon gamma may be insufficient to rescue these mice this late in the infection."
1392,26288,"Our results show that infection by S. suis induces suilysin-dependent apoptosis which is very likely to be responsible for the damage and death of differentiated epithelial cells. Results of experiments with the complemented strain cW461F revealed that macropore-formation of suilysin is required for induction of apoptosis in airway epithelial cells. However, at present it remains unclear what the underlying mechanisms are. In S. pneumoniae a pneumolysin-induced calcium influx has been shown to mediate apoptosis in neuronal tissues 52, 53 . Thus, it is plausible to speculate that suilysin-induced apoptosis in airway epithelial cells may be initiated by calcium influx through the pores in the plasma membrane. Calcium influx induced by suilysin was observed in HEp-2 cells (unpublished data). Whether this can be translated to PBEC remains to be clarified in future studies."
1393,2625514,"Unlike the passive immunisation of ruminants by colostral transfer from vaccinated dams mentioned above, the active vaccination of newborns has to face an important limitation: the active vaccination of young animals that have detectable serum concentrations of maternal antibodies will not successfully stimulate immunity because maternal antibodies will have a blocking eect on vaccinal antigens [43] . This obstacle can be avoided: (i) by administering colostrum free of antibodies directed against the vaccinal antigens, although we admit that this is dicult to perform in the ®eld and probably only of importance in an experimental approach; (ii) by carefully selecting antigens that are not recognised by maternal antibodies. Here we refer to the development of T-cell vaccines against Theileria and Babesia, where antigens are selected on their potential to stimulate T-cells and not on their recognition by antibodies [44, 45] ; (iii) by administering the vaccine in mucosal or other sites, that are less sub-jected to neutralisation by maternal antibodies in circulation; or (iv) by nucleic acid vaccination. Moreover, any immune response provoked by an active vaccination of neonates must necessarily be a primary response with both a relative long period of latency and a low concentration of antibodies produced. Since animals can be exposed to Cryptosporidium from their day of birth, it is questionable whether an active vaccination is capable of mediating any signi®cant immune protection against such an early infection. However, the Cryptosporidium vaccine would not be designed to evoke a sterile protection, but rather to reduce production losses caused by clinical illness."

1395,606064,"Several species of non-human primates (NHP) were evaluated as animal models for SARS.

Except for squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins [185] , all of the evaluated NHP species facilitated the replication of SARS-CoV [186] . Virus replication was detected in the respiratory tract of rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques, and African green monkeys. Pneumonitis was observed in each of these species in different studies [176] [177] [178] 182] . SARS-infected common marmosets displayed a fever, watery diarrhea, pneumonitis, and hepatitis [183] . Unfortunately, research into the clinical signs of disease in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques gave conflicting results and therefore needs further investigation.

1398,1738742,"QCT-1 used in some of the tests reported here offers several advantages over the existing AOAC methods. 14 It has been designed to (1) permit the determination of the exact number of CFU remaining after the drying of the inoculum; (2) avoid wash off of any of the test organism; (3) allow complete recovery of the inoculum from the carrier surface; (4) arrest the test substance's activity by dilution immediately at the end of the contact time; (5) in the case of bactericidal, mycobactericidal, and fungicidal tests, capture all the cells of the test organisms on a membrane filter before and after exposure to the test product; (6) remove any residual microbicidal activity by a thorough rinsing of the membrane filter; (7) incorporate glass inserts to eliminate any false-positive results because of the generation of microaerosols in the carriers; and (8) give a precise determination of log 10 reduction in CFU of the test organism after exposure to the product under test. It therefore, eliminates the deficiencies associated with the AOAC methods. Because the QCT-1 meets the requirements for microbicide testing as in the Canadian General Standards Board, 18 data based on it are acceptable for product registration in Canada."
1399,1453932,"A key feature of a potentially pandemic influenza virus is its ability to spread efficiently from infected to noninfected hosts (ie, its transmissibility). The molecular basis of influenza virus transmissibility remains unresolved. 15 Like the 1918 virus, H5N1 influenza has unusually high virulence. Although the 2 viruses differ in their transmissibility among humans, there is concern that currently circulating H5N1 viruses will evolve into a pandemic strain by adapting to humans through genetic mutation or reassortment with human influenza strains. Fortunately, there has been no direct evidence of efficient poultryto-human or human-to-human transmission to date. 16 Nevertheless, probable person-to-person transmission of avian influenza A(H5N1) was reported. The index patient was an 11-year-old girl who lived with her aunt. She became ill 3 to 4 days after her last exposure to dying household chickens. Her mother came from a distant city to care for her in the hospital, had no recognized exposure to poultry, and died from pneumonia after providing 16 to 18 hours of unprotected nursing care. The aunt also provided unprotected nursing care; she had fever 5 days after the mother first had fever, followed by pneumonia 7 days later. Autopsy tissue from the mother and nasopharyngeal and throat swabs from the aunt were positive for influenza A(H5N1) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. No additional chains of transmission were identified, and sequencing of the viral genes identified no change in the receptorbinding site of hemagglutinin or other key features of the virus. The sequences of all 8 viral gene segments clustered closely with other H5N1 sequences from recent avian isolates in Thailand. It was concluded that the disease in the mother and aunt probably resulted from person-to-person transmission of this lethal avian influenza virus during unprotected exposure to the critically ill index patient. 17, 18 However, a study from Vietnam showed a lack of H5N1 avian influenza transmission to hospital employees. 19 The incubation period in the reported cases seemed to be 2 to 4 days, similar to that in cases of human influenza, followed in most patients by fever, cough, and dyspnea. Diarrhea was variably reported, and sore throat and runny nose were noted in some of the patients. A striking feature was marked lymphopenia in those patients who were severely ill. Unlike cases of human influenza, in the H5N1 avian virus cases, primary viral pneumonia was common, whereas secondary bacterial pneumonia has not been reported. 20 An epidemic of avian influenza A(H7N7) occurred in The Netherlands in 2003, which affected 255 flocks and led to the culling of 30 million birds. To evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures, a study quantified between-flock transmission characteristics of the virus in 2 affected areas. The control measures markedly reduced the transmission of the virus. The study suggests that the containment of the epidemic was probably due to the reduction in the number of susceptible flocks by complete depopulation of the infected areas rather than to the reduction of the transmission by the other control measures. 21 A recent report described the occurrence of infection with the virus in household contacts of human index cases, in the absence of contact with infected poultry, suggesting human-to-human transmission of the virus during the 2003 poultry epidemic. 22, 23 In 2004, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H7N3) occurred in poultry in British Columbia, Canada. Surveillance identified 2 persons with confirmed avian influenza infection. Symptoms included conjunctivitis and mild influenza-like illness. 24 Why is H5N1 of particular concern? Of the avian influenza virus subtypes, H5N1 is of particular concern for several reasons. It mutates rapidly and has a known propensity to acquire genes from viruses infecting other animal species. Its ability to cause severe disease in humans has now been documented. In addition, laboratory studies have demonstrated that isolates of this virus have a high pathogenicity and can cause severe disease in humans. Birds that survive infection excrete virus for at least 10 days, orally and in feces, thus, facilitating further spread at live poultry markets and by migratory birds. H5N1 variants demonstrated a capacity to directly infect humans in 1997, and have done so again in Vietnam and other countries since 2003. The spread of infection in birds increases the opportunities for direct infection of humans. If more humans become infected over time, the likelihood also increases that humans, if concurrently infected with human and avian influ-enza strains, could serve as the bmixing vesselQ for the emergence of a novel subtype with sufficient human genes to be easily transmitted from person to person. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. 2 The last century saw pandemic influenza viruses belonging to 3 subtypes (H1, H2, and H3) , and indirect evidence suggests that H3 viruses were circulating from 1889 to 1918 and that H1 viruses were possibly prevalent before 1889. If this series of events over the last hundred years reflects a pattern, recycling of subtypes would be the norm in the human population, and the possibility for the emergence of new pandemics would be limited. On the other hand, if any subtype is able to thrive in the human population, a greater number of possibilities for novel pandemic strains would exist. Although H5N1 avian viruses were shown to cause death in humans, none of these strains were easily transmitted from human to human. Also, none of the H5N1 strains showed evidence of having acquired genes from circulating human influenza viruses. Whether this is a necessary requirement for a pandemic strain to be successful is not known. It would seem probable that such a reassortment event between an avian and a human influenza virus could have happened many times over, either in humans or in animals. It may be possible that infections of humans by avian influenza viruses have been ongoing for decades, and it is only the reporting that has improved in recent years. If this were the case, the present emphasis on the imminent pandemic outbreak would not be justified. 25 However, the precursor of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus has been shown to have repeatedly crossed species barriers, probably for many years, before it finally acquired the capacity for human-to-human transmission, and its pathogenicity to humans was not attenuated. 26 Because the H5N1 virus continues to evolve and spread, with additional human infections occurring in many countries, we cannot afford simply to hope that human-to-human spread of the virus does not happen, and that if it does, the pathogenicity of the virus will attenuate. 8 What is warranted and where there is little or no disagreement among scientists is a continued surveillance of influenza viruses. Stockpiling of antiviral drugs and the development of new vaccines are highly recommended to be better prepared for a potential pandemic outbreak. 25 Recent advances in recombinant technologies have shown the possibility of constructing premade libraries of vaccine strains, so that adequate preparations can be made for epidemics and pandemics. 27 Cross-protection against multiple influenza A subtypes can be induced in animals by prior infection or vaccination. Multiple viral antigens and multiple immune effector mechanisms can participate. Mucosal vaccination induces different immune responses than systemic vaccination and is more effective at inducing broad cross-protection to multiple influenza A subtypes in animals. Broad cross-protection in humans is of unclear potency and duration, but epidemiological data suggest that it may have an impact. A variety of vaccines may induce broad cross-protection if administered appropriately. Imperfect vaccine protection is worth having, especially for a virus causing an acute (not latent) infection. It could provide a first line of pandemic defense to be augmented by subtype-or strain-specific vaccines when available. 28 More recent articles also reviewed and discussed the development of cross-protective vaccines. [29] [30] [31] [32] Both adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) were believed to be effective against a pandemic virus, although emergence of resistance has apparently occurred with adamantanes, and the more recent type A(H5N1) virus as well as some currently circulating seasonal viruses are not susceptible to this drug class. 30 A recent study showed that stockpiles of neuraminidase inhibitors that cover 20% to 25% of the population would be sufficient to treat most of the clinical cases and could lead to 50% to 77% reduction in hospitalizations. 33 Another study indicated that current stockpiling of oseltamivir appears to be cost saving under several treatment strategies, including therapeutic treatment of patients and postexposure prophylactic treatment of patients' close contacts. 34 In addition, antimicrobial agents can help control secondary bacterial infections, which could have been the cause of death among many patients during the 1918 pandemic. 6 In view of the threat of a potentially serious influenza pandemic, many governments have drafted pandemic influenza preparedness and response plans. The US draft plan was posted in August 2004. The plan stressed the need for improved measures to safeguard the public. In particular, steps need to be taken in the areas of surveillance, vaccine development and production, antiviral stockpiling, research, and public health preparedness. A key part of the plan is to establish public safety measures and coordination with state and local levels. 35 The formal plan was launched by the Department of Health and Human Services (Washington, DC) in November 2005 (www.dhhs. gov/pandemicflu/plan/). On April 1, 2005, the US government issued a directive allowing authorities to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza when arriving in the United States aboard an international flight. Under the directive, the Health and Human Services Department is given legal authority to detain or isolate any passenger suspected of having avian influenza to prevent the person from infecting others (Reuters, April 1, 2005) ."
1400,164737,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the seventh pathogenic human coronavirus to be identified and the third with a predilection for causing potentially fatal pneumonia, after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection is highly transmissible but has a relatively low death rate (1·0-3·5%), except in older people (aged >70 years) with comorbidities. 1,2 It is estimated that 15-20% of people infected develop severe pneumonia and 5-10% require critical care. 2 COVID-19 preparedness in countries with a surge in new cases have prioritised containment, rapid diagnosis, and fastidious contact tracing. With sustained community transmission, real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) of viral nucleic acid could be supported by more versatile diagnostic tools because of concern over false-negative results and limited availability. It has been suggested that CT could play a role in COVID-19 case ascertainment. Driven by a sustained daily increase in new cases, the diagnostic criteria in China originally included CT."

Although the global prevalence of schizophrenia is D 0.4%, 2 it represents a large burden to families and society. These patients also have high mortality rates and comorbid medical conditions. If they are more susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection, have worse clinical outcomes once contaminated, or have psychotic relapses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be an additional burden to a system that is already pressed to the limit. To help families and policy makers make better informed decisions and develop preventive measures, we intend to address the following questions: Are schizophrenia patients at higher risk of: 1) being contaminated; 2) mortality; and 3) suffering a psychotic relapse?"

1404,395846,"From November 2002 until July 2003 the world was confronted with the first pandemic of the new millennium, caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) inducing the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in humans (SARS) [57] [58] [59] . The pandemic spread from its origin, a wet-market in the Guangdong province in China, through 33 countries on five continents resulted in more than 8000 infected humans of whom more than 700 eventually died [60, 61] . The search for the animal reservoir began, identifying masked palm civets and bats as possible sources. Subsequently, a plethora of diverse coronaviruses of distinct groups have been detected in various bat species around the world via molecular-biological techniques. In 2012, another human-pathogenic coronavirus, called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), began spreading from the Arabian Peninsula, so far resulting in globally 707 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 252 deaths [62] . Dromedaries and bats are suspected as reservoirs for MERS-CoV [63] . Recent findings support the plausibility of dromedaries as reservoir species [64] ."
1405,2423101,"Families and visitors are often unaware of the role their contaminated hands can play in the transmission of infection in healthcare settings. It is well-documented that respiratory viruses such as rhinovirus and influenza can survive for hours to days on surfaces. 15, 28 Hand contact with contaminated hands and surfaces has resulted in fingertip acquisition of rhinovirus 22%-70% of the time. 16, 17, 29 People frequently touch their faces, with almost half of the touches contacting mucous membranes. 30 As a result, there are numerous opportunities for hands to become contaminated with respiratory viruses and serve as a vector to patients. It is common to instruct families and visitors to wash their hands upon entry to the NICU, but given the frequent opportunities for re-contamination after touching their face and contaminated surfaces, moving the timing of hand hygiene to immediately before contact with their child will likely improve the effectiveness of hand hygiene."

1407,307439,"The incubation period after a tick bite is usually 1 to 6 weeks but occasionally as long as 3 months. Manifestations range from asymptomatic infection to a fulminant, malarialike infection that rarely may be fatal. Symptoms are generally flu-like and may include malaise, chills, myalgia, anemia, fatigue, and fever (which can approach 40°C). Some patients also have nausea, emesis, night sweats, weight loss, and hematuria, which are believed to be associated with high levels of parasitemia. Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly may also be present. The parasites primarily infect erythrocytes. In most cases, infection and disease are acute, but as pointed out above, there may be some degree of chronicity. Immunocompromised, aged, and asplenic patients are at particular risk of developing serious, even fatal, disease as a result of transfusion transmission of the agent. While usually self-limiting, more severe cases are treatable with clindamycin and quinine; more recently, a combination of atovaquone and clindamycin has been shown to be effective, with fewer side effects. 3 Disease manifestations and potential exposure history contribute to an initial diagnosis, but exposure may be inapparent. A history of blood transfusion (particularly in an endemic area, although cases have occurred as a result of blood imported from endemic areas) may raise suspicion. Laboratory diagnosis should include examination of stained blood smears and tests for antibodies using immunofluorescence. PCR also may be helpful, but these procedures are available only on an investigational basis. Donor screening tests are not currently available. 2 At present, no measures effectively prevent transfusion transmission of Babesia. While a history of tick-bite would appear to be a useful screen, it is neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific. 4 Travel history suffers from the same problems, and the possibility of prolonged parasitemia reduces the efficacy of restricting donations from areas of high endemicity during the tick season. Clinicians in areas of high risk should be aware of the possibility of transfusion-associated Babesia infection and its treatment."

1409,2667264,"The HCV-0C43 strain (McIntosh et al., 1967) was originally obtained from Dr. Marion Cooney of the University of Washington, Seattle, and was propagated on a human rectal tumor (HRT) cell line (Tompkins et al., 1974) . The virus harvested from the medium of infected cell culture was purified according to published procedures (Makino et al., 1984) and viral RNA was extracted as described (Kamahora et al., 1979) . The purified viral genomic RNA was initially used for cDNA cloning using oligo (dT) as a primer for reverse transcription. Subsequent cDNA cloning followed essentially the procedures of Gubler and Hoffman (1983) , as modified by Shieh et al. (1987) . Several cDNA clones specific for HCV-OC43 were obtained; one of these, T16, has a 0.6 kilobase (kb) insert and hybridized to all of the virus-specific subgenomic mRNA species in Northern blot analysis (data not shown). This result suggests that T16 represents a cDNA clone of the 3'-end of the genomic RNA since the subgenomic mRNAs of coronaviruses have a 3'-end co-terminal nested-set structure (Stern and Kennedy, 1980; Lai et al., 1981) ; thus, only the cDNA probe representing the 3'-end of the genomic RNA could hybridize to all of the subgenomic mRNA species."
1410,1457749,"Basically, the authors compare a test with moderate sensitivity (~70 %) to detect the viral RNA from a nasal or pharyngeal swab sample [2] with a blood test that measures the immune response of a host to the viral exposure. It is textbook knowledge that it takes about 5 to 10 days for IgM antibodies to become prevalent. So it is predictable from the chosen methodology that a substantial number of PCR-positive samples have to be negative in the antibody test. It is also predictable that an antibody test is not really suitable to identify newly infected subjects. And this is not how it should be used! A point-of-care antibody test can e.g. be used to differentiate people with past infections (and potential immunity) from people that have not had the infection yet. In case that recent reports are confirmed that people with past infections may become asymptomatic carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus [3] , the antibody tests may be the only way to differentiate PCR-positive subjects into two groups: i.) patients who are freshly infected and may soon develop clinical symptoms (negative IgG result) and ii.) patients who have developed antibodies and may now be asymptomatic virus spreaders (positive IgG result)."
1411,1828670,"In addition to these practical issues, there are regulatory issues that need to be addressed. So far, only one guideline for the quality and (non-)clinical aspects of live recombinant viral vectors exists [148] . In the case of influenza, special procedures are in place in the European Union to speed up the authorization process for novel vaccines. In the case of a pandemic, the vaccine needs to become available as soon as possible. The normal procedure to approve a new vaccine takes 18-24 months, which obviously is too long for a novel vaccine in the case of influenza pandemics. Therefore, there are two procedures in place for authorization of pandemic influenza vaccines. The first one is the 'mock-up procedure', where a prototype vaccine is authorized. It is not possible to predict which strain will cause a pandemic. Therefore, a vaccine based on a strain that has the potential to induce a pandemic is developed and tested. This proof-of-principle vaccine is then registered. Once the viral strain that is actually causing a pandemic is identified, this can be included in the mock-up vaccine and approved quickly. Second, the 'emergency procedure' allows for fast-track approval of a vaccine after a pandemic already started. With such an emergency procedure, a vaccine can be approved in 70 days. MVA and other vector-based vaccines are not covered by these pandemic influenza vaccine registration procedures. So, even though a MVA-based vaccine can be developed and produced relatively quickly after a pandemic outbreak, the vaccine will not be available in time to prevent a widespread pandemic."
1412,1389767,"Influenza viruses contain a segmented, single stranded (-) RNA genome. The genus is divided in three types, A, B, and C, based on specific epitopes on the internal nucleoprotein and the matrix protein. Human influenza A virus strains are further'clas&ied in the subtypes HlNl, H3N2 and the presently not circulating H2N2 subtype, based on the antigenic differences of the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. Laboratory diagnosis of infections with influenza virus is mainly performed by culturing a respiratory sample, nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs, for 16 24 h, with, subsequently, an immunofluorescent analysis of the propagated virus or by direct immunofluorescence (Espy et al., 1986; Stokes et al., 1988) . Recently, the polymerase chain reaction '(PCR) has ,b&n used for detection of numerous pathogens and the""technique appeared to be very sensitive and specific (Wright and Wynford-Thomas, 1990 ). Amplification of influenza RNA genome segments by RNA-PCR has also been carried out. The technique was used for obtaining, rapidly, nucleotide sequence information (Katz et al., 1990; Robertson et al., 1990; Ludwig et al., 1991) and a nested PCR was used for typing and subtyping of cultured influenza strains (Zhang and Evans, 1991) . In addition, some applications to clinical specimens are described. Influenza A hemagglutinin can be amplified from nasopharyngeal lavages (Bressoud et al., 1990) and throat swabs (Yamada et al., 1991) . However, the genome segments coding for the H and N surface glycoproteins show a great variability in their RNA nucleotide sequences and are, therefore, not suitable for the development of a type specific PCR for influenza A. Other segments of the influenza A genome are much more conserved in their nucleotide sequences. In influenza B and C strains the segmented genomes contain conserved segments as well (Air and Laver, 1990; Lamb, 1989) ."
1413,489967,"This report describes the current epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States, using preliminary data. The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, data were missing for key variables of interest. Data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, were missing for 9%-53% of cases, which likely resulted in an underestimation of these outcomes. Second, further time for follow-up is needed to ascertain outcomes among active cases. Third, the initial approach to testing was to identify patients among those with travel histories or persons with more severe disease, and these data might overestimate the prevalence of severe disease. Fourth, data on other risk factors, including serious underlying health conditions that could increase risk for complications and severe illness, were unavailable at the time of this analysis. Finally, limited testing to date underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 cases. Additional investigation will increase the understanding about persons who are at risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 and inform clinical guidance and community-based mitigation measures.* The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed (7) .

1415,1862690,"In order to discover the neurovirulence of SARS-CoV-2 and relate it to neurological tissue expression of ACE2, data retrieval was done from human protein databases. Most of the evidence of ACE2 expression in the brain ( Figure 1 ) comes from literature and mammalian tissue expression databases, 2 which prompted us to investigate neurotropic effects of SARS-CoV-2 and its contribution toward the morbidity and mortality of patients with COVID-19. 3.1. Evidence of the Distribution of ACE2 in the Human Brain. The brain has been reported to express ACE2 receptors ( Figure 1A , C) that have been detected over glial cells and neurons, which makes them a potential target of COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the ability of SARS-CoV to cause neuronal death in mice by invading the brain via the nose close to the olfactory epithelium. 3 The contribution of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 in patients reported in the recent outbreak of COVID-19 remains to be established. In the SARS-CoV infections that were reported in the past, autopsy findings of the patients have shown strong evidence of the presence of SARS-CoV by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR 3 . Patients with acute SARS-CoV illness have also demonstrated the presence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid. The role of the blood-brain barrier in containing the virus and preventing it from gaining access to the neural tissues needs to be further explored in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Recently, a study posted in medRxiv 4 has reported neurological manifestations in COVID-19 in the current outbreak that involved 214 patients, of which 78 (36.4%) patients had neurologic manifestations, which affirms our rationale of the neurotropic potential in the COVID-19 virus. Also, a finding published on a patient who had loss of involuntary control over breathing 5 during the recent outbreak with several other patients suffering acute respiratory failure implores healthcare professionals and clinicians to segregate COVID-19 patients into neurologically affected cases and those who are devoid of neurological deficits."
1416,930104,"signaling with enhanced aldosterone-mediated MR activation could represent an important link between SARS-CoV-2/ACE2 interaction and inflammatory lung injury, suggesting an interesting therapeutic potential of RAS inhibitors [1] and in particular MR antagonists. However, it has been claimed that RAS inhibitors could enhance ACE2 expression, which might represent a possible drawback of this therapeutic strategy, as this might influence SARS-CoV-2 infectivity [1] . Importantly, in contrast to other RAS inhibitors, the MR antagonist spironolactone also possesses significant antiandrogenic actions [5] . Such effects may be particularly useful in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection, by inhibiting the androgen-dependent expression of TMPRSS2, a transmembrane protease crucial for viral entry through its priming effect on the viral S protein [5] . Therefore, by its dual actions as an MR antagonist and an androgenic inhibitor, spironolactone might provide significant benefits in COVID-19 ARDS. Naturally, the primary action of spironolactone (reduction of pulmonary edema) would also be beneficial in COVID-19 ARDS. Thus, we hypothesize that through its combined pharmacological actions, spironolactone may provide therapeutic benefit, when applied in the later stage of COVID-19 ARDS. Clinical trials may be warranted to evaluate its therapeutic potential. Fig. 1 Sites of potential pharmacological actions of spironolactone in COVID-19 ARDS. SARS-CoV-2 infects type II alveolar epithelial cells (type II AEC) via interaction between its spike S protein and ACE2 receptor, promoting internalization and degradation of ACE2 and pulmonary ACE/ACE2 imbalance. In turn, the degradation of angiotensin II (AT II) into angiotensin 1-7 (AT 1-7 ) is prevented (dotted lines), reducing anti-inflammatory signaling through the Mas receptor (MasR), and promoting pro-inflammatory AT II signaling through the angiotensin receptor type I (AT1R) in vascular endothelial cells. Increased AT II results in aldosterone formation, which signals through the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), leading to vascular inflammation and immune cells activation. MR activation polarizes macrophages towards the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1Mϕ), favors CD4 + lymphocytes differentiation towards pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, and induces cytotoxic IFNγ + -CD8 + lymphocytes. The development of a hyper-inflammatory state may trigger ARDS. MR inhibition with spironolactone may interrupt the deleterious actions of aldosterone. Furthermore, via its anti-androgenic effects, spironolactone may decrease the expression of TMPRSS2, a serine protease priming the S protein for its interaction with ACE2.

We monitored viral spread using bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at day 2 and 4 after infection [14, 15] . Interestingly, at both time points we observed a decreased viral spread in female WT mice when compared to males. Moreover, lack of CD200 resulted in a significantly lower level of viral replication in females ( Figure 1A ,B and Figure S1A ,B,C). The viral RNA load in the livers at day 4 was assessed by quantitative PCR and confirmed the imaging results: WT female mice had significantly lower viral RNA levels than WT male mice ( Figure 1C) . Again, CD200-deficiency greatly decreased virus load in female mice. This was confirmed in histological liver sections stained with a monoclonal antibody against MHV (data not shown).

The average age was 52.9 years (SD 6 16), including 107 men and 97 women. Although most patients presented to the hospital with fever or respiratory symptoms, we found that 103 patients (50.5%) reported a digestive symptom, including lack of appetite (81 [78.6%] cases), diarrhea (35 [34%] cases), vomiting (4 [3.9%] cases), and abdominal pain (2 [1.9%] cases). If lack of appetite is excluded from the analysis (because it is less specific for the gastrointestinal tract), there were 38 total cases (18.6%) where patients presented with a gastrointestinal-specific symptom, including diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Patients with digestive symptoms had a significantly longer time from onset to admission than patients without digestive symptoms (9.0 days vs 7.3 days). In 6 cases, there were digestive symptoms, but no respiratory symptoms. As the severity of the disease increased, digestive symptoms became more pronounced. Patients with digestive symptoms had higher mean liver enzyme levels, lower monocyte count, longer prothrombin time, and received more antimicrobial treatment than those without digestive symptoms."
1422,276716,"The data obtained from pediatric patients with acute respiratory disease indicate that the WUPyV and KIPyV prevalence is low (1.4% and 0.2%, respectively) in Italy, comparable to that established in other countries [Le et al., 2007; Foulogne et al., 2008] . WUPyV and KIPyV infections can occur early in childhood, and these viruses are the only detectable pathogens in 50% of the infections. These data indicate that the novel human polyomaviruses play a role as respiratory pathogens or co-pathogens in infants."
1423,1165680,"In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People (BHRP) transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model, and R 0 was calculated based on the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2."

He was previously treated with interferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod. His past medical history includes allergic rhinitis, asthma and peptic ulcer. In January 2018 treatment with ocrelizumab was started within the compassionate use program for PPMS. He also started lamivudine prophylaxis due to the presence of positive HBV anti-core antibody. Periodic 6-month ocrelizumab infusions were performed until August 2019 (a reinfusion was planned in February 2020 but was delayed due to patient convenience and rescheduled in March 2020). At the time of the last infusion patient had moderate hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 6.5 g/L, reference range 8-17 g/l) with normal IgM and IgA levels, and peripheral blood lymphocyte immunophenotype showed profound B-cell depletion (8 CD19+ cell/mm 3 ).

1425,2323660,"Sequencing reads were analyzed with a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline (https://github.com/ozagordi/VirMet). In the filtering step, reads are trimmed by removing low-quality bases and removed if shorter than 75 bp, if their average PHRED score is below 20 or if they have low entropy (i.e., they consist mainly of repeats). Reads passing quality filters are cleaned from nonviral reads by aligning with STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) against the following genomes in this order: human, bacterial, bovine, canine. The latter 2 genomes are included to eliminate contaminating reads originating from fetal calf serum and from Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells. Reads not matching any of the above genomes are blasted (Camacho et al., 2009 ) against a viral database that contains approximately 35,000 different complete viral genomes. This database was created from sequences downloaded from GenBank nuccore that 1) have the expression ""complete genome"" in the title, 2) are of viral origin (organism taxonomy id is child of id 10239, denoting all viruses), and 3) are not of cellular origin (excluding all organisms children of id 131567, denoting cellular organism) in order to avoid chimeric sequences. For each sequencing read that passed the filter step, we report the blast hit with minimum e-value, provided that coverage and identity of the hit are higher than 75%. Reads matching neither genome nor any viral sequences were reported as of unknown origin."
1426,186079,"Viral respiratory tract infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, representing an enormous economic and disease burden [1] . Respiratory viruses replicate in the respiratory tract from where they are subsequently shed and transmitted via respiratory secretions. They are classified in different virus families and differ in virulence and target groups. Respiratory tract infections may range from asymptomatic to acute live threating disease thereby posing a major health threat to young children, elderly, and immunocompromised people. Respiratory viruses spread via three different transmission routes: contact (direct or indirect), droplet and aerosol transmission (Table 1) [2, 3] . Contact transmission refers to direct virus transfer from an infected person to a susceptible individual (e.g. via contaminated hands) or indirect virus transfer via intermediate objects (fomites). Transmission of virus through the air can occur via droplets or aerosols. The commonly accepted cut-off size between the large droplets and small aerosols is 5 mm, although this varies considerably between studies, ranging up to 12 mm [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Droplets generated during coughing, sneezing or talking do not remain suspended in air and travel less than 1 m before settling on the mucosa of close contacts or environmental surfaces. Aerosols have a slow settling velocity, thus they remain suspended in the air longer and can travel further [5, 9, 10] ."
1427,1852379,"It can be remarked from Fig. 2 (bottom panel) that the global fit of the SIRD model to the outbreak in China, while predicting the observed position of the epidemic peak, it does so at the price of a worse interpolation of the initial growth and of the final decay of the I population. Concurrently, the model fails to follow the observed rapid recovery and overestimates the number of deaths. This is most likely due to the harsh containment measures adopted by the Chinese government in order to curb the spread of the disease. A simple way to test this hypothesis is to restrict the fit to the initial growth phase before the onset of the peak. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 . Indeed, it can be appreciated that a model that does not include any external curbing action on the infected population reproduces quite nicely the initial growth phase, places the peak at the correct time, but fails to match the swift recovery rate and decline of the infection in the window where the imposed restrictions are assuredly in action."
1428,3110387,"The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months, while healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with nearoptimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity."
1429,1219030,"During EP&R events, supply chains may rapidly evolve to incorporate drugs and/or devices authorized through EUA mechanisms. On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an EUA for the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate products donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to be distributed and used for certain hospitalized patients with COVID-19 24 although as of this date, these drugs are not FDA approved for this use. These drugs will be distributed from the SNS to states for providers to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions. 24 To prevent misuse and hoarding, twenty two (22) states issued guidelines for pharmacists who are being allowed to ""use their professional judgment when filling prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine"" to ensure adequate supplies for patients with ongoing need for these medications for legitimate and/or pre-existing conditions such as lupus. 25 Guidance for remaining states are pending and pharmacy organizations and Boards of Pharmacy in these states should work to ensure that there are adequate measures taken to ensure medications for patients who currently need them. On March 31, 2020, the FDA announced a new program known as the Coronavirus Treatment Acceleration Program (CTAP) to use every tool at the agency's disposal to bring new therapies to sick patients as quickly as possible, while at the same time supporting research to further evaluate whether these medical countermeasures are safe and effective for treating patients infected with this novel virus. 24 Working conditions and occupational safety: During a pandemic or similar infectious disease healthcare crises, there are competing issues for HCWs and the settings in which they work: (1) providing public access to essential services and (2) protecting HCWs from infection and other harms."

Virus isolation attempts using different canine cell lines were unsuccessful although the C T values obtained in real-time PCR amplification were suggestive of high viral titers in the inocula.

1431,1285831,"Upon stimulation by a host signal during penetration into the skin, arrested hookworm infective larvae assume feeding and development, and simultaneously secrete many proteins related to migration and parasitism in the host. Some of those activated secreted proteins are called Ancylostoma-secreted proteins or activation-associated secreted proteins (ASPs) [51, 52] . This group of proteins exists in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, including plants, vertebrates and invertebrates including helminths, and belongs to the large family of cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAPs) [53] , also known as sperm-coating protein (SCP)like extracellular proteins, or SCP/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7 (SCP/TAPS) proteins [54] . Except for their association with establishment of parasitism in the host, the exact function of ASPs remains mostly unknown. Recent studies have demonstrated that Na-ASP-2 of the human hookworm N. americanus binds to the human B-cell antigen receptor complex CD79A and downregulated about 1,000 B-cell messenger RNAs including factors involved in leukocyte transendothelial migration pathways and the B-cell signaling receptor pathway, indicating nematodesecreted ASP/CAP proteins may cause immunomodulation as a strategy of immune evasion [55] . Vaccination with recombinant ASP-1 or ASP-2 secreted by hookworm larvae produced significant protective immunity in different animal models [17, 23, 56] . Unfortunately, the larvae-secreted ASPs induced an IgE response during natural infection and pre-existing anti-Na-ASP-2 IgE caused a significant allergic response upon vaccination with recombinant Na-ASP-2, which has stopped the development of Na-ASP-2 as a vaccine in endemic areas [19] . However, it has been shown that ASP's fusion to human IgG Fc fragment could significantly reduce the anti-Na-ASP-2 IgE-triggered histamine release [57] . The A. ceylanicum genome contains a total of 432 ASP genes, more than any other hookworm species described so far [21, 34, 58, 59] . Except for those secreted by activated larvae, some well-studied ASPs are only expressed in adult worms [60] . In this study, we identified 62 ASP genes expressed in the hookworm intestine, of which 11 are within the 100 most abundant gene products in the intestine, second only to the protease group (Table 5 ; Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Phylogenetic analysis suggests that these ASPs are closely related to the adult worm expressed proteins, Ac-ASP-3, Ac-ASP-4, Ac-ASP-5 and Ac-ASP-6 [60] , but less related to the larvae-secreted Ac-ASP-1 [51] and Ac-ASP-2 [52] (Fig. 6 ). Due to their specific expression in the adult intestine, these proteins are not expected to be exposed to the host immune system, and therefore there is less concern regarding the induction of an IgE response during natural infection, possibly making them suitable vaccine antigen candidates."
1432,2255267,"syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), causes fatal acute respiratory disease (ARD) resembling that of SARS-CoV Guan et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020) . The pathophysiology for SARS-CoV-2 has not been well studied, but likely resembles that of SARS-CoV; the acute lung injury caused by SARS-CoV infection mainly results from aggressive inflammation initiated by viral replication (Wong et al. 2004 ). Similar to SARS-CoV infection, SARS-CoV-2 infection also causes increased secretion of IL-1b, IFN-c, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-4, and IL-10 (Huang et al. 2020 ). In addition, compared with non-ICU (intensive care unit) patients, ICU patients with severe disease had higher plasma levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, GCSF, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, and TNF-a, suggesting a possible cytokine storm associated with disease severity . Nevertheless, the causes of these exuberant inflammatory responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unknown. In this review, we attempt to discuss and summarize possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses (Fig. 1 ). In addition, given that uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation is likely a leading cause of fatality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we also attempt to speculate possible therapeutic interventions that may be applied to attenuate inflammatory responses in order to reduce mortality (Fig. 2) . enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV for infection, suggesting the likelihood of the same set of cells being targeted and infected Zhou et al. 2020) . The early onset of rapid viral replication may cause massive epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage, triggering the release of exuberant pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Yang 2020) . In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also cause pyroptosis in macrophages and lymphocytes (Yang 2020) . A vast majority of patients (82.1%) have been found to experience SARS-CoV-2-induced peripheral blood lymphopenia (Guan et al. 2020) , suggesting possible pulmonary infiltration of lymphocytes and/or cell damage through apoptosis or pyroptosis . In SARS-CoV infection, viroporin 3a has also been shown to trigger the activation of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3) inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1b in bone marrowderived macrophages, suggesting the induction of cell pyroptosis , which can cause the release of large amounts of proinflammatory factors (Fink and Cookson 2005) ."
1433,1788964,"The present study demonstrates the problems in defining aetiological relationships for respiratory viral illnesses. Many more episodes of respiratory illness were detected in the test population than could be accounted for by the diagnostic tests used in the study. Influenza infections were the primary focus of the study and influenza B/AA/1/86 was by far the most predominant pathogen. No attempts were made to screen for Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR), which is now recognized as a major cause of respiratory morbidity, 9 ' 10 or human coronavirus 229E, which is a significant upper respiratory tract pathogen."" No rhinoviruses or adenoviruses were isolated and nor were other less common respiratory pathogens such as echoviruses, Coxsackie viruses or enteroviruses. Eight of 47 viral infections were asymptomatic, as were all four proven infections due to M. pneumoniae. A greater rate of seroconversion in symptomatic volunteers without evidence of infection would probably have been detected if a serological test more sensitive than the complement fixation procedure had been used for RSV, adenovinises and M. pneumoniae. Infections due to RSV occurred in three older volunteers, which is consistent with suggestions from other studies that suggest that RSV is a cause of significant respiratory morbidity in adults 12 ' 13 and severe pneumonia in the elderly. 14 We were able to detect viruses by culture or IFA in only 13 of 37 acute nasal and/or throat washings in volunteers who had experienced a clinically defined illness with aetiology demonstrated by retrospective serology. Our isolation rate would have undoubtedly been improved by the application of more sensitive procedures that do not involve cell culture, including the use of the polymerase chain reaction and time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays that were not available at the time of this study. Female volunteers appeared to experience more episodes of infection than males, especially in the younger than 20 and 31-35 year cohorts ( Figure 2 ). This could be due to greater exposure to infection in households through contact with children although, surprisingly, there were no trends in incidence according to the number of children in the households of either male or female volunteers (unpublished observations). There was no substantial difference in the incidence of episodes experienced by non-smokers (comprising 27% of the study population) and smokers with differing habits. However, these data are unlikely to be representative of either smokers or nonsmokers, which is reflected in the occupational status of the subjects and the prevalence of smoking which is approximately twice a recently reported Australian level. 13 Previous comparative studies have indicated an increased incidence of respiratory infections among smokers. 16 Of interest is the range of single and dual infections by viral pathogens that appear to produce clinically indistinguishable symptoms. These findings do not bode well for the widespread therapeutic application of newer respiratory antiviral drugs, which are likely to be highly specific in their mode of action for particular respiratory viruses, most of which have relatively short phases of acute illness. Such antiviral drugs could not be used without major advances in the accessibility of rapid viral diagnostic techniques (within 12-24 hours) and similar considerations apply to evaluations of the efficacy of influenza vaccines according to clinical outcomes. Although we obtained bacteriological results from 58 individuals with defined episodes of respiratory illness, of whom 15 had an established viral infection, our study also provides no basis for the prophylactic use of antibiotics in normal adult populations. The profile of bacteria from acute samples taken from volunteers with and without concurrent viral infection was no different from that of others before entry to the study and there was no evidence of synergism involving changes to the bacterial flora of the respiratory tract following viral infection. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics for respiratory viral infections is a severe impost of modern health care budgets and it is especially interesting that, despite the limitations of our bacteriological sampling, no group A P-haemolytic streptococci were isolated."
1434,821213,"Residents of rural and urban locations had similar numbers of contacts except in those locations with the highest population density, where the number of contacts was reduced. While this reduction is in part explained by a higher prevalence of older individuals in these locations, it may also be evidence of 'urban isolation' [27] in a rapidly developing region of China. There is also the possibility this reflects a sampling bias, as most urban contacts happen outside of the home, hence the most social individuals may be harder to capture in our study (because they are frequently absent from home). The most marked rural-urban differences are found in the locations in which contacts occur, with more contacts occurring within the home in rural areas, but contacts made outside of the home occurring further from the home. This is in contrast to a previous study of travel patterns in a different province of China [28] which found rural populations stayed significantly closer to home than more urban populations. The frequency of more distant contacts among those living in rural communities (2% are 25 km or further from home) suggest that an emerging pathogen arising in a rural population will have numerous opportunities to make long distance jumps, and that containment may be difficult."
1435,1034583,"Concurrently, these animals were presenting with FCGS, and both cases were infected with calicivirus. This disease could have lead to a more difficult management of DM. In the first case the animal went into clinical DM remission and few days later the FCGS symptoms worsened. In the second one, the FCGS was a clinical problem during insulin therapy. Despite being associated with a previous good clinical improvement and a reduction of lesions, corticosteroids were contraindicated in both cases. Therefore, based on previous clinical trials [12] , an oral protocol of rFeIFN-ω was successfully applied. In both cases, clinical improvement was gradually observed and was significantly marked (and noted by owners, who remarked that the animals started eating without discomfort and had reduced hypersalivation) around 60 days after the onset of therapy. This was particularly evident in the second case where rFeIFN-ω therapy was associated with a clinical improvement of oral lesions and a concurrent reduced insulin dose requirement which culminated in type II DM remission. This is in agreement with the previously cited work that describes an overall relief of pain in refractory cases of FCGS [12] . It is also in agreement with multiple anecdotal reports that describe a rapid improvement in well-being in cats with FCGS during oral rFeIFN-ω treatment, but with a period of three to six months being necessary in some severe cases before the lesions are fully resolved, especially where there has been regular previous use of corticosteroids (D. McGahiepersonal communication). Although there are no studies that clearly detail the immunomodulatory mechanisms of oral rFeIFN-ω use, it has been proven that oral human interferon-alpha administration may potentiate a local T-helper 1 response (Th1) [23] . In fact, human interferon-alpha seems to increase the expression of gamma-interferon, a Th1 cytokine inducer, while it reduces the Interleukin-4 production, responsible for a T-helper 2 response [23] . Recognizing that the Th1 response is an important immunological pathway against viral infections [23] , it seems reasonable that rFeIFN-ω and human interferon-alpha (both type I interferons) may have a similar local action. Therefore, this Th1enhancement may explain the clinical improvement observed in these calicivirus positive cats during rFeIFN-ω therapy. Further controlled prospective studies are needed to reinforce these clinical findings, correlating them with the local immune response. These two clinical cases describe the successful use of oral rFeIFN-ω in diabetic cats with FCGS as an appropriate alternative to corticosteroid treatment where its administration is contraindicated.

1436,1783044,"The known epidemiological characteristics of COVID19 point to urgent priorities. Shortening the time from symptom onset to isolation is vital as it will reduce transmission and is likely to slow the epidemic (appendices 2, 3) However, strategies are also needed for reducing household transmission, supporting home treatment and diagnosis, and dealing with the economic consequences of absence from work. Peak demand for health services could still be high and the extent and duration of presymptomatic or asymptomatic transmission-if this turns out to be a feature of COVID19 infection-will determine the success of this strategy. 16 Contact tracing is of high importance in the early stages to contain spread, and modelbased estimates suggest, with an R 0 value of 2·5, that about 70% of contacts will have to be successfully traced to control early spread. 17 Analysis of individual contact patterns suggests that contact tracing can be a successful strategy in the early stages of an outbreak, but that the logistics of timely tracing on average 36 contacts per case will be challenging. 17 Superspreading events are inevitable, and could overwhelm the contact tracing system, leading to the need for broaderscale social distancing interventions."

1438,952869,"Data extracted from the selected studies included the first author's name, publication date, country, dates of recruitment, ethnicity, total sample size (divided to males and females), age, prevalence of symptoms (including fever, shortness of breath, sore throat, cough and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, APACHEII) and percentage of comorbidities at the time of presentation (including obesity, immunosuppression or HIV and heart conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and/or coronary arterial diseases) (Tables 1 and 2). Weighted average was used to calculate the average age and the overall prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities. Publication bias was assessed both by the visual inspection of funnel plot ( Figure 2 ) and by Egger's test. Egger's test is widely used to assess the tendency for the effects estimated in small sample size studies to differ from those estimated in larger studies. The results of Egger's test are presented in terms of bias coefficient. To measure the prevalence of diabetes in the two viral conditions, we extracted the proportion of the disease in the reported cases of severe respiratory infections. A subgroup analysis was carried out by region, only for the H1N1 studies (Table 3) . Region subgroup analysis for MERS-CoV was not doable since all the identified studies were conducted on Saudi populations, with one study of pooled analysis where region/country designation was not possible. The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV cases. The meta-analysis of proportions (and 95% CIs) was calculated for the identified studies ( Figure 3 ) and in a subgroup analysis within each region (Table 3) . Meta-analysis tests were conducted using the OpenMeta Analyst version 10.10, a free, cross-platform, open-source program. 48 We used binary random-effects model since we assumed that the relationship between diabetes and severe respiratory infection is varied across populations. T-test was used to compare between average age in H1N1 and MERS-CoV since this factor was normally distributed in the two sets of studies. Mann-Whitney Utest was employed to compare the prevalence of clinical symptoms and comorbidities between the two diseases as these conditions were not normally distributed. To assess whether there is true heterogeneity among the selected studies and that all the studies are evaluating the same effect, we used the Q test. 49 Q test only informs about the presence versus the absence of heterogeneity and does not report on the extent of such heterogeneity. Therefore, we calculated the I 2 index to complement the Q test and quantify the degree of heterogeneity among studies. 50 Given the poor power of Q test to detect true heterogeneity among a small number of studies, we also quantified the true heterogeneity by estimating the between-study variance in the random-effects model (τ 2 ), as previously described. 51 P<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Forest plots were used to illustrate the prevalence of diabetes in H1N1 and MERS-CoV severity from the selected studies and to inspect the heterogeneity of the individual findings. "

To test the suitability of this approach, we infected a HeLa cell line stably ex-pressing a GFP-tagged ribosomal protein RPL27 (34) with Ad5. RPL27-GFP was used as a nucleolar marker in live cells and in isolated nucleoli. At 18 h postinfection, the cells were harvested, and nucleoli were isolated using a standard protocol (29, 35) . As shown in supplemental Fig. 1 , live cell imaging revealed that the RPL27-GFP signal in the nucleolus of infected cells (supplemental Fig. 1C ) was similar to that in untreated cells (supplemental Fig. 1A ). The GFP signals in nucleoli isolated from untreated (supplemental Fig. 1B ) and infected (supplemental Fig. 1D ) cells were also similar, although the nucleoli from infected cells appeared slightly larger. Interestingly, adenovirus infection induced the appearance of RPL27-GFP in threadlike structures in the nucleoplasm. The significance of the accumulation of this ribosomal protein in these structures or the apparent slight enlargement of nucleoli is unknown. The threadlike GFP-containing structures were not observed in the isolated nucleolar preparation, suggesting that the preparation was not contaminated with nucleoplasmic materials and was suitable for future proteomics analysis."
1444,1231471,"The cDNA from plasmids pTSI 5-1 and pF4F-36 was subcloned into M13mp vectors using either the shotgun method (Bankier and Barrell, 1983) or by using specific restriction fragments and sequencing entirely in both directions. The corresponding DNA sequence 37 bp from the 5' end of the first open reading frame to the poly(A) tail is illustrated in Fig. 2 . The cDNA was translated in all six reading frames, of which only the translation in the virussense strand revealed any open reading frames. The longest open reading frame, initiating from the ATG at position 38, of 1149 bp overlapped both cDNA inserts and encoded a potypeptide of 382 amino acids, with an M^ of 43483. The basic nature and size of the polypeptide indicated that it corresponded to the viral nucleoprotein which is observed to have M, 42 000 and 47 000 in TGEV-infected cells and M, 47 000 in virions (Garwes et al., 1984) . The difference between the theoretical and predicted molecular weights of the protein may result from the degree of phosphorylation. Garwes ef al. (1984) for TGEV and Stohlman and Lai (1979) for MHV have shown that the nucleoproteins are phosphorylated on serine residues, which represent 41 (11 %) of the residues in strain FS772/70 and 39 (10%) in the Purdue strain of TGEV (Kapke and Kapke and Bnan (1986) . the nucleoprotein (bases 39-1185) and a hypothetical hydrophobic prote,r^bases,t921428)ThACTAAACdTGGGr!S^^^^^^1"

1446,859991,"The 4-aminoquinoline chloroquine, another 'old' compound best known for its antimalarial effects, but also accredited with antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, has been recommended for its potential use, preferably in combination with other antivirals, in the treatment of AIDS as well as SARS [87] . Chloroquine (FIGURE 14B) was found to inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells at an EC 50 of 8.8 µM (CC 50 = 261 µM; selectivity index = 30) [88] . These inhibitory effects were observed when the cells were treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus [89] . The EC 50 of chloroquine for inhibition of SARS-CoV in vitro approximates the plasma concentrations of chloroquine reached during treatment of acute malaria [88] . Inhibition of SARS-CoV infection in vitro has also been reported for a nitric oxide (NO) generating compound, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), but only at an EC 50 as high as 222 µM and a selectivity index as low as 2.6 [90] . Niclosamide (FIGURE 14C ), an existing antihelminthic drug, was able to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV in Vero cells at an EC 50 of 2 µM, while its CC 50 was 250 µM; its selectivity could therefore be estimated at 125 [91] ."

1448,1451615,"The proportion of the population susceptible at the start of the pandemic determines the relationship between R and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ), which is the number of secondary cases generated by a primary case in a completely susceptible population 2 . Frost hypothesized that a 1918 pandemic-like strain spread throughout America in the spring of 1918 (ref. 22) , and recent analyses support this 'herald wave' hypothesis 23 . Anecdotal evidence suggests that those who fell ill in the spring were protected from letters to nature disease in the autumn pandemic 24 . Nevertheless, a large majority of the population was probably susceptible to the A/H1N1 pandemic strain in September 1918. In a typical epidemic transmission season, 15-25% of the population becomes infected with influenza 4 . The herald wave is believed to have arrived late in the 1917-18 transmission season. Using 70% as a conservative lower bound for the fraction susceptible at the start of the autumn pandemic, the medians for our initial and extreme R 0 are 2.9 and 3.9."
1449,263833,"The SARS-CoV is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of 29,727 nucleotides that encodes four structural proteins including the spike glycoprotein (S), the nucleocapsid protein (N), the membrane protein (M) and the small envelope glycoprotein (E), and several nonstructural proteins most of which, like in other coronaviruses, are of unknown functions (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The spike S protein binds to members of the DC-SIGN family and to the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Jeffers et al., 2004; Li et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2004) , thereby mediating the entry of the virus into the target cells.

We identified a group of approved drugs that could inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and thereby inhibit viral infection of cells (appendix). The drug targets are members of the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family-including AAK1 and GAK-the inhibition of which has been shown to reduce viral infection in vitro. 5, 6 Baricitinib was identified as a NAK inhibitor, with a particularly high affinity for AAK1, a pivotal regulator of clathrinmediated endocytosis.

1457,920500,"While there is limited understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, extensive studies have been performed on how its closely related cousins, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), invade host cell. Upon initially contacting the surface of a host cell, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV exploit host cell proteases to prime their surface spike glycoproteins (SGPs) for fusion activation, which is achieved by receptor binding, low pH, or both (Belouzard et al., 2009; Matsuyama et al., 2018) . The receptor binding domain (RBD) resides within subunit 1 (S1) while subunit 2 (S2) facilitates viral-host cell membrane fusion (Belouzard et al., 2009) . Activated SGP undergoes a conformational change followed by an initiated fusion reaction with the host cell membrane (Belouzard et al., 2009) . Endocytosed virions are further processed by the endosomal protease cathepsin L in the late endosome (Huang et al., 2006; Matsuyama et al., 2018) . Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV require proteolytic cleavage at their S2' site, but not at their S1-S2 junction, for successful membrane fusion and host cell entry (Belouzard et al., 2009; Matsuyama et al., 2018) . Additionally, receptors involved in fusion activation of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV include heparan sulfate (HS) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively (Lang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2005; Raj et al., 2013) .

1459,723649,"Arthritis usually developed with a sudden onset in a peripheral joint, and rapidly progressed over the next few days. As in RA, the distribution of affected joints was predominantly symmetric (85% of the affected joints were symmetric at day 35). A locus on chromosome 6 (Pia3) was linked to the day of arthritis Days after pristane injection letter onset, but an indication of linkage was also found on chromosome 4; this linkage became significant (Pia2) when only females were analysed, despite the decrease in power by the reduced number of rats. This indicates that the gene is dependent on a female context. Both loci appear to control a delayed disease onset in a DA recessive mode (Fig. 4) ; that is, they contain disease susceptibility genes derived from E3. None of the loci controlling arthritis onset influenced further progression of the disease (Fig. 4) . A major locus (Pia4) was found on chromosome 12 that controls arthritis severity during the early period between day 20 and day 45 in the (E3×DA) F2 cross (Table 2, Fig. 2c ). DA alleles promoted disease in an additive fashion (data not shown). The strongest linkage was seen with the number of affected paws between day 28 and 35, during a period in which joint erosion was most extensive. As a consequence, high serum levels of carti-lage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were linked to the same region, during the same period, with an identical inheritance pattern at day 35 (Fig. 2) . Thus, COMP and number of affected paws on day 35 showed a positive correlation (R s =0.66, P<1×10 -7 ). We also observed possible, but not significant, influence on arthritis onset and chronicity by Pia4 (Fig. 4) ."
1460,312326,"Nanoparticles (NPs) may provide an ideal solution to alleviate problems associated with the nasal delivery of DNA vaccines. Chitosan (CS) NPs are of special interest in nasal DNA vaccine delivery because of its unique properties, including bioadhesiveness, effectiveness in transport of antigens by transiently opening tight junctions of cells, biocompatibility and low toxicity [17, 18] . More evidences have shown that DNA vaccine complexed with the CS significantly improved mucosal sIgA levels via i.n. administration [19, 20] . As a DNA vaccine delivery system, the CS NPs are expected to increase the uptake and expression efficiency of the DNA vaccine in target cells. However, as compared to other non-viral carriers, the CS NPs mediated transfection efficiency is still relatively low [21, 22] . It has been suggested that the strength of electrostatic interactions between CS and DNA prevents their dissociation within cells, thus precluding transcription of DNA and resulting in low transfection [23] ."

1463,2614090,"Altogether, our study has significantly increased the number of cellular proteins known to interact with the DENV RNA during a live infection in cells. We have also placed these interactions in the context of proteome abundance changes in the infected cells. A recent study by Phillips and colleagues [13] exploited a cross-linking label-free MS approach to identify DENV RNA associating proteins in cell culture by cross-linking the RNA to the proteins using short wavelength UV light and isolating DENV RNA bound proteins by anti-sense DNA affinity capture [74] . While their method identified several DENV host factors [12, [75] [76] [77] , the qTUX-MS method reported here resulted in improved identification of known dengue host factors and putative DENV RNA interacting proteins. There could be several reasons for these results, such as, the qTUX-MS approach achieves greater cross-linking efficiency by using long wave UV light to form crosslinks to 4-thio-uridines compared to short-wavelength UV light, which is inherently inefficient [78] . Moreover, since thio-uridine is a zero distance cross-linker for RNA-bound proteins at long UV wavelengths and protein-protein cross-links are not formed at long UV wavelengths, qTUX-MS may also have achieved improved specificity, as only proteins in direct contact with the viral RNA would be captured [23] . Additionally, qTUX-MS used an MS-based SILAC approach to determine which host proteins were specifically enriched in the vRNA isolations versus mock. Though isotope-labelling is not applicable in all model systems, it does afford greater quantitative accuracy compared to label-free MS strategies [16] ."

We found a highly restricted, immunoglobulin Gdominated antibody response in patients with SARS, directed most frequently (89% by ELISA) and predominantly at the nucleocapsid. Almost all of the subjects without SARS had no antinucleocapsid antibodies. The spike protein was the next most frequently targeted, but only 63% of the patients (by ELISA) responded. Other targets of the response identified by use of WB included antigens of 80 and 60 kDa.

1472,3041397,"To analyze the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and the drugs that can be used to treat pregnancy with COVID-19, so as to provide evidence for drug selection in clinic. By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs. The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus. However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future."
1473,2934226,"This review deals with a particular class of viruses known as multipartite viruses, first described in the 1960 decade, 9, 10 In the literature, multipartite viruses have been also called coviruses, multicomponent, multiparticle or multicompartment viruses. Here, we are considering three main types of viral genome configurations that will be termed non-segmented, segmented and multipartite. Non-segmented and segmented viruses transport all the genetic material needed to complete the viral cycle inside a unique viral particle; multipartite viruses have by definition segmented genomes, and their chromosomes are distributed among two or more virus particles. Co-infection is therefore a requirement for survivability of this latter type. There are many more open questions than certainties in our understanding of multipartite viruses. [11] [12] [13] Among all, the main puzzle is why multipartite viruses do exist at all. 14 Though mostly limited to plants, multipartition may have appeared repeatedly in evolution. Certainly, multipartitism is not anecdotal, neither a frozen evolutionary accident nor a serendipitous discovery. Despite our current lack of knowledge on the mechanisms that may endow multipartite viruses with an adaptive advantage that compensates for their apparently weird and costly lifestyle, there is no alternative but beginning by assuming that multipartitism is a stable evolutionary strategy, sensu Maynard-Smith. 15 We start by summarizing known (and some new) facts on the biology of multipartite virus. For further details on the molecular biology of multipartitism the reader is referred to recent reviews that have tackled this issue in depth. 12, 16 Our main goal here is to discuss possible scenarios for the origin and evolution of multipartitism as an evolutionary strategy, and highlight perspectives for its study. From a systems biology viewpoint, multipartite viruses could be better depicted as complex ensembles of genes that, perhaps transiently, associate in a cooperative fashion to yield a variety of viral species. 17 We contend that multipartitism can only be understood in an ecological context, that is when the host and the epidemiology of multipartite viruses-and other possible associated selection pressures-are taken into account. Comparing multipartitism and alternative genomic architectures, as well as exploring the environments where multipartitism occurs might pave the way towards disentangling the actual costs and advantages of this as of today puzzling lifestyle."

If suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases are found during hospitalization, the patient should be transferred to the isolation ward for further treatment."
1476,1296870,"In the present experiments, not all the pigs became sick after intracerebral inoculation and the disease consisted of the vomiting and wasting syndrome. These results are somewhat different from those described by GREIG, who obtained clinical signs consisting of motor central nervous disorders in all inoculated pigs (7) . This may be related to the observation that, with the present virus isolate, only the vomiting and wasting syndrome has been observed, not only in the original outbreak but also in experimental pigs. It should be mentioned, however, that MENGELING was able to reproduce both clinical entities with the same virus isolate (10) . The inability to find the virus in the cerebral cortex of ON inoculated pigs may indicate that the present isolate has little or no affinity for this part of the central nervous system. It is not impossible that, in intracerebrally inoculated pigs, the appear-ance of clinical signs is determined by the ability of the virus to reach the pons + medulla, another possible target organ, from the deposition site."
1477,1906573,"We estimated that the average ascertainment rate in Wuhan between 1 and 22 January was 5.0% (95%CI, 3.6-7.4), reflecting the difficulty in identifying cases of a novel pathogen. Given the generally good accessibility to healthcare in China, this suggests that the majority of infections may be of mild illness and insufficiently serious for individuals to seek treatment. However, it is worth noting that a number of identified cases have died (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 2020) and that the true case fatality rate has yet to be estimated accurately. Also, asymptomatic infection has been reported for 2019-nCoV (Chan et al., 2020) . We also estimated the size of the epidemic in Wuhan at the time of the market closure (1 January) to be 15 individuals (95%CI, 5-37). Our estimates of epidemiological parameters are sensitive to our assumption regarding the length of the latent period; see Figure 2 . Early epidemiological investigations suggest a duration between 3 to 6 days (Chan et al., 2020) , Should the latent period be longer than the 4 days we assume, our 0 estimates would be higher and the estimated ascertainment rate slightly lower; see Figure 2 ."
1478,2838414,"Furthermore, 5-HT mechanisms were studied because currently, the clinical literature is reporting both positive (13) and negative support (30) for the dopaminergic hypothesis of cocaine reinforcement. Extending the dopaminergic hypothesis to other neurotransmitters then is becoming crucial in terms of cocaine treatment modalities. A 5-HT mechanism is a good candidate for study because psychiatric and emotional disorders, including anxiety, have as their underlying neurobiological etiology, deficits in 5-HT functioning (16) . Indeed, cocaine has been reported to cause such psychiatric disorders (15) . A review of the literature shows (a) that cocaine is a potent reuptake inhibitor of 5-HT at the synapse (28), (b) that cocaine depressed 5-HT levels, postmortem (24) , (c) that cocaine decreased 5-HT synthesis and turnover post mortem (11) , (d) that impulse frequency in dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was depressed by cocaine (5) and (e) that there may be a role for the reinforcing effects of cocaine through a 5-HT mediation (22) . As is with DA mechanisms, 5-HT-cocaine interactions are associated with transporter mechanisms (25) . Thus the second purpose of this paper was to study the effect of cocaine on the indoleamine, 5-HT, in nucleus accum- 05, 95% confidence limits of the mean (CL)] between ten and twenty minutes after cocaine injection. Cocaine significantly decreased synaptic 5-HT (p<0.05, 95% CL) between forty and fifty minutes after cocaine injection (cf. the Results section for ANOVA statistics). (b) The effect of cocaine HCI (20 mg/kg SC) on synaptic concentrations of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in nucleus accumbens of behaving rats. Cocaine significantly increased synaptic DA (p<0.05, 95% CL) and significantly decreased synaptic 5-HT (p<0.05, 95% CL) between one and ten minutes after cocaine injection (cf. the Results section for ANOVA statistics)."
1479,2999359,"The emergence of PEDV in North America in April 2013 and the apparent inability to prevent the virus from spreading rapidly through the swine population has raised important questions on transmission between farms and countries. Concerns over the role of SDPP in PEDV transmission were raised, when geographically unrelated pig operations without known contact points, but with a common commercial feed source almost simultaneously became infected with PEDV [15, 16] . SDPP is derived from slaughter age pigs without clinical signs of disease. Recently it has been determined that under extreme experimental conditions, PCV2, a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that is very resistant to temperature changes, can survive the spray-drying process and retain infectivity [17] ; however, the PCV2 in commercial product has been repeatedly demonstrated to not be infective [5, 6, 18] . Under similar conditions, RNA viruses like porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) were inactivated successfully [19] . The main objective of this study was to determine the infectivity of commercial SDPP positive for PEDV RNA in a conventional pig model."

1481,1175837,"The DEAD-box RNA helicases play multi-functional roles in RNA transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, ribosome biogenesis, RNA transport, translation initiation and RNA decay (Edgcomb et al., 2012; Fuller-Pace, 2013; Ishaq et al., 2009; Valiente-Echeverria et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2010) . Recently evidence in the literature suggests that interactions with RNA helicases contribute to the lifecycle of positive sense RNA viruses. For example, DDX1 facilitates replication of a number of viruses such as: Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) by interacting with HIV-1 Rev protein (Edgcomb et al., 2012) ; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHM strain (JHMV) through interactions with nsp14 (Xu et al., 2010) and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (Wu et al., 2014) ; and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) by binding to the 3 0 (þ) UTR and 5 0 (À) UTR (Tingting et al., 2006) .

1483,1901513,"The spreading of the 2019 New Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2) has evolved from a contagion originally confined within Wuhan, China, in December 2019, rapidly to a global contagion, which has spread to 87 countries within two months. The numbers of confirmed infection cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran have surged in the last two weeks, reaching 7,313, 5,883 and 5,823, respectively, on March 8, 2020. The global fatality rate, however, remains below 3%. In this study, we build on the result of our previous work [4] that establishes a library of parameters of an augmented SEIR model, corresponding to the historic spreading profiles of 367 cities in China. This library forms a set of profile codes that cover a variety of possible epidemic progression profiles. By comparing the early incomplete data of epidemic progression collected for a specific population with the historic profiles, we select a few candidate profiles from the historic archive using a nonlinear optimization procedure. The corresponding profile codes of the selected historic progression profiles can then be used to produce estimates of the future progression for that specific population. We apply this method to predict the spreading of COVID-19 in South Korea, Italy and Iran. Results show that the three countries will soon see infection peaks in most cities in the coming 2 to 3 weeks, with South Korea's cases reaching their peaks slightly earlier than the others. The percentage of population eventually infected will be less than 0.3%, 0.05% and 0.02% for South Korea, Italy and Iran, respectively. The epidemic is expected to end before June 2020, and depending on the effectiveness of treatment, particular cities may see full recovery or zero infection sooner or later than others. It is worth noting that the epidemic progression in South Korean cities are found to be more rapid than typical, implying that the authorities might have taken effective measures to control the spread. The predicted progressions for Italy and Iran, on the other hand, are found to display profiles that are typical of those in the historical archive, and unless more stringent measures are taken, the peaks and subsequent decline of the infection numbers will unlikely come sooner or more rapidly than the predicted trajectories. Finally, we should stress that the proposed data-driven coding method is applicable to predicting epidemic progression in any given population and the accuracy of prediction will depend on the adequacy of the available data in allowing a reliable match to be identified from the historical archive."
1484,2915349,"We analyze the transmission dynamics of stuttering chains using the theory of branching process [22, 40, 41] . The key component of this theory is the probability generating function, Q(s)~P ? i~0 q i s i of the offspring distribution. This function describes the probability distribution for the number of new infections that will be caused by each infected case. The probability that an infected individual directly causes i infections is q i , and hence the probability that an individual is a dead-end for transmission is q 0 . Subject to the standard assumption that transmission events are independent and identically distributed, Q(s) contains all the information needed to determine the size distribution of stuttering chains."
1485,432332,"During an epidemic of an infectious disease, many healthcare workers including nurses on the front lines caring for patients with the disease suffer from mental health problems (Khee et al., 2004) . At the peak of the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Taiwan, nurses at a hospital caring for 27 suspected cases had trouble with psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and hostility (Chen, Cheng, Chung, & Lin, 2005) . In Singapore, 27% of healthcare workers during the SARS outbreak were reported to have psychiatric symptoms (Chan & Huak, 2004) . Fear and nervousness were the distressful experiences reported by healthcare workers taking care of patients with MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (Khalid, Khalid, Qabajap, Barnard, & Qushmaq, 2016) .

1486,1308476,"The SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, emerged in the City of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in early Person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by ""who interacts with whom"", 9,10 which can vary by age and location of the contact i.e., school, work, home, and community. Under the context of a largescale on-going outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, social distancing measures including but not limited to school and workplace closures and health promotions that encourage the general public to avoid crowded places are designed to drastically shift social mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings. 4 While contact patterns can be inferred from reported social contact data that include the information in which setting the contact took place, such studies are often focused on high-income countries, 11 or particular high-density areas. 12 Prem and colleagues 13 address that limitation by quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work and other locations across a range of countries based on available information from household-level data and local population demographic structure."
1487,2037985,"The severity of porcine epidemic diarrhoea can be linked to several parameters such as the animal age, the infectious dose, the susceptibility of pigs, the environmental conditions or the viral strain (Shibata et al., 2000) . The objective of this study was to compare the pathogenicity and transmissibility of an American non-InDel strain considered highly pathogenic and an InDel strain isolated in France in 2014 in experimental conditions. In case of infection with a non-InDel and an InDel strain, 100% of morbidity (except for the InDel indirect contact pigs) was observed, but clinical signs were not apparent at the same time among the two types of PEDV-infected groups. As early as 1 dpi, the first clinical signs were observed for the non-InDel strain, although the InDel strain induced the first clinical signs only at 5 dpi. These results are in agreement with previous experimental studies involving the non-InDel strain reporting the occurrence of diarrhoea and occasional vomiting from 2 to 10 days after inoculation (Crawford et al., 2015; Madson et al., 2014; Niederwerder et al., 2016; Shibata et al., 2000) and also with previous studies involving InDel strains reporting the appearance of clinical signs within 1 week after infection Mesquita et al., 2015; Stadler et al., 2015) . Intermittent clinical signs were also noticed with the two strains after the occurrence of the first clinical signs; InDel-infected pigs showed clinical signs (occasional diarrhoea, vomiting and despondency) from 8 to 49 dpi, and non-InDel-infected pigs showed clinical signs from 3 to 46 dpi."
1488,2872791,"While Tregs are immunosuppressive at sites of inflammation, Tregs may express transcription factors and cytokines that parallel those of Tconv cells. Thus, Tregs express T-bet and IRF4 at sites of Th1 and Th2 inflammation, respectively [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, we and others have shown that Foxp3 + Tregs express IFN-c during infections [5, 8] . Unfractionated populations of Tregs harvested from inflammatory sites, which include cells expressing IFN-c, remain immunosuppressive. Suppression can be demonstrated in T cell proliferation assays after stimulation with either anti-CD3 mAb or virus-specific peptides [8] . In contrast, other studies suggest that a pro-inflammatory milieu may result in diminished Treg suppressive function [9] [10] [11] .

1490,2445608,"Evaluations and planning has focused on mass casualty incidents isolated to specific communities. [13] [14] [15] There has been no published and distributed plan instituted for residents in such a population health scenario as presented by COVID-19. For example, residents' roles in the disaster response to the Boston Marathon bombing was unclear. There was no understanding if residents would be expected to provide surge staffing or if they would be stratified by experience. 13 Though most hospitals train nurses and attendings for mass-casualty events, fewer than half train residents. 14, 15 This is a gap in medical education that should be addressed as these incidences are unfortunately becoming more frequent. Most resident staffing during crises is managed ad hoc by chief residents or program directors. Communications should be in place, whether by group text, online meeting applications or other local mechanism, so that chief residents act as a liaison between institutional command, attending physicians and resident teams. It is likely that trainees could be asked to work beyond scheduled duty hours. Local graduate medical education leadership should be involved in preparations, and knowledge of ACGME program requirements is essential. It is possible residents will be asked to work beyond accepted duty hours, and these exceptions should be made known to the ACGME, but exemptions should be provided given the national emergency. Graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and Chief Residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined."

1494,2911212,"In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken the world by storm, it is imperative to protect the health and safety of physicians and staff involved in acute management of COVID-19 patients. Numerous studies have been published, establishing evidence and opinion-based guides for emergency physicians, who are at the front line. Although many have established pathways for dealing with patient screening, testing, prognosis and disposition, I would like to discuss the management of the crashing patients in need of ventilation who we ought to be prepared for the most. As of now, it is essential to contain a crashing suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient within the confines of a negative isolation chamber due to a high risk of aerosolization, with strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE), exclusively comprising of N95 or preferably a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) (1). Most experienced staff should look after the patient, in order to minimize contamination to few personnel only. Since conventional methods of Non-invasive mechanical ventilation (CPAP/BiPAP) are inadvisable due to aerosol generation, it is suggested to secure a definitive airway with extreme precaution (2) . Pre-oxygenation can be performed with a Bag Valve Mask device with positive end expiratory valve and a viral filter, if available. It is recommended to form a good facemask seal with both hands, while making sure not to deliver any positive breaths (2) . Induction and relaxant medications should be administered at a maximum dose in order to prevent cough or gag reflex during the procedure (3). A video laryngoscope should be used so as to avoid having the operator position their face close to the patient. The most senior physician should at-tempt maintaining the airway, in order to maximally ensure first pass intubation success; however, in a failed airway scenario, attempts should be made to establish a surgical airway immediately. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should be positioned at a predetermined depth and secured properly. Avoid auscultation attempts to prevent instrument contamination, and look for bilateral chest rise or end tidal capnography waveform. If available, a viral filter should be connected to the adapter of the ETT, and another should be placed at the exhalation port of the ventilator (2) . A plastic transparent sheet can be placed over the patientâȂŹs head and chest to prevent droplet spread (4). All contaminated instruments should be placed in a transparent bag for immediate disposal and/or decontamination. The ARDSnet (acute respiratory distress syndrome network) protocol should be followed for patient ventilation. In case of poor PaO2/FiO2(PF) ratio (<150), place the patient in prone position (5) . Allow for permissive hypercapnia (pH > 7.2), if hemodynamics remain stable (6, 7) . Do not give fluid boluses and maintain the patient in negative balance (8) . If needed, place a central venous access line in femoral site for administering vasopressors to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure. Following intubation and initial ventilation, immediately proceed to transfer the patient to intensive care unit, after which, perform decontamination of the initial zone and the equipment used. Consider meticulous removal of PPE and debrief."

1498,427827,"For RNA viruses, most attention has been directed towards mutation, selection and genetic drift. We can understand their importance and interaction by considering four basic properties of RNA virus populations. First, RNA viruses often have very large population sizes, such that the number of viral particles in a given organism might be as high as 10 12 . Second, such immense population sizes, which are several orders of magnitude larger than those observed for cellular organisms, are a product of explosive replication. For example, a single infectious particle can produce an average of 100,000 viral copies in 10 hours. As natural selection is most efficient with large populations, it is no surprise that experiments using RNA viruses have shown that selection is of fundamental importance in controlling their evolutionary dynamics, such that new mutants with increased FITNESS (as measured by their selection coefficient, s) continually appear and out-compete older, inferior alleles 4 . Third, owing to the lack of proofreading activity in their polymerase proteins, RNA viruses exhibit the highest mutation rates of any group of organisms, approximately one mutation per genome, per replication 5, 6 . Finally, the genome sizes of RNA viruses are typically small, ranging from only 3 kb to ~30 kb, with a median size of 9 kb. These last two properties are intimately related because high-mutation rates are theoretically expected to limit genome size. In particular, a mutation rate that exceeds a notional ERROR THRESHOLD (set at approximately the reciprocal of the genome size) generates so many deleterious mutations in each replication cycle that even the fittest viral genomes are unable to reproduce, and population size decreases to extinction 7, 8 . However, RNA viruses that exist close to (but below) the error threshold are also THE POPULATION GENETICS AND EVOLUTIONARY EPIDEMIOLOGY OF RNA VIRUSES population that would experience genetic drift in the same way as the actual population. N e can be lower than the census population size (N) owing to various factors, including a history of population bottlenecks and variance in reproductive rates."

After alignment of the N proteins of FIPV and TGEV two divergent regions, which may represent immunologically important domains in the N protein, were found. Since the N protein is not exposed on the outside of virus particles, these domains may represent T-cell epitopes rather than B-cell epitopes."

1503,2045466,"Due to the unreliability on harvest of phytochemicals from natural resources and the complexity in producing natural products through chemical synthesis, one has to look for an environment friendly and renewable production system to fulfill the need of food and pharmaceutical industries. Plant cell culture technology emerging as an attractive alternative system, can continuously provide high-value ingredients independent of geographical, climatic or environmental variations and constraints [8, 9] . Over the past years, plant cell suspension cultures for the production of secondary metabolites have been hampered by several limitations, such as low yields of desired compounds, expensive culturing process, application of phytohormones, heterogeneous cell types, lack of storage tissue, and products easily degraded by the enzymes released in the media [9, 10] . One way around this problem has been the development of specialized differentiated or plant organ cultures instead of cell suspension cultures, best exemplified by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-based hairy root cultures (HRCs). HRCs induced by the infection of wounded plant tissues with A. rhizogenes bearing the root-inducing (Ri) plasmid, possess comparable biosynthetic capacity of secondary metabolites to native plant roots with advantages of fast growth rates independent of phytohormones, genetic and biochemical stability, long-term preservation, and sizable biomass production [11] . More importantly, HRCs often accumulate phytochemicals at a higher level as against undifferentiated cell suspension cultures [12] . Herein, it is believed that the transformation of I. tinctoria by A. rhizogenes could result in hairy root lines with the potential to biosynthesize FL for research or food, agricultural and pharmaceutical applications."
1504,2030020,"Protein 7a consists of 122 amino acids and is probably the best studied SARS-CoV accessory protein. It was the first accessory protein for which proapoptotic abilities were demonstrated (Tan et al. 2004a ). In several transfected as well as infected cell lines, expression of 7a was confirmed (Fielding et al. 2004; Kanzawa et al. 2006; Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2006; Nelson et al. 2005; Tan et al. 2004a; Yuan et al. 2006) . Notably, it was detected in lung tissues from SARS-CoV infected patients (Chen et al. 2005) . Protein 7a also appears to be a structural component of the virion (Huang et al. 2006a) . With regard to the cellular localization, discrepancies exist as to whether it localizes to the ER, the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, or the trans-Golgi network (Fielding et al. 2004; Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2006; Nelson et al. 2005) . Tan et al. however proposed that it is synthesized in the ER and shuttles rapidly to the Golgi or to mitochondria ). The induction of apoptosis by 7a has been observed in several studies (Kopecky-Bromberg et al. 2006; Tan et al. 2004a Tan et al. , 2007 Yuan et al. 2006) . Its proapoptotic properties appear to be common for many cell types as over-expression of 7a induced the apoptotic pathway in cell lines originating from different tissues such as lung (A549 cell line), kidney (Cos-7, Vero E6, HEK293), cervix (HeLa), and liver (Hep-G2) (Tan et al. 2004a) . Moreover, contribution to the modulation of apoptosis in the viral context has been confirmed. (Schaecher et al. 2007 ) demonstrated that a recombinant virus with deletion of ORF7a did not show alterations in replication kinetics or viral progeny but the mode of DNA fragmentation induced in infected Vero E6 cells was significantly altered as compared to cells infected with the wildtype virus. Furthermore, in this study a population of SARS-CoV infected cells which exhibited DNA fragmentation but no active caspase-3 was observed at 48 h and 72 h postinfection. This population was not detected if cells were infected with the respective ORF7a deletion mutant. Therefore, these cells might represent a population in a late stage of apoptosis in which active caspase-3 is undetectable or, as DNA fragmentation can also be observed during necrosis, might alternatively represent a population of necrotic cells (Schaecher et al. 2007) . The induction of cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase appears to be a common feature of several accessory proteins and it was shown that transient over-expression of 7a in HEK293, Cos-7, and Vero E6 cells resulted in a deregulated cell cycle (Yuan et al. 2006 (Kanzawa et al. 2006 ). These discrepancies concerning involved mediators or effectors imply that the protein 7a probably uses alternative or several ways to induce apoptosis. Tan et al. recently demonstrated that 7a induces cell death by directly interacting with the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, thereby preventing the interaction with proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Consequently, 7a-induced apoptosis could be abrogated by over-expression of Bcl-xL . A further hint for the putative role of 7a in cell death scenarios was recently obtained in yeast-2-hybrid screens in which the proteins BiP and Bik were found as interactors of 7a (Diemer, Schneider, Schätzl and Gilch, personal communication)."
1505,644415,"As a structural glycoprotein on the virion surface, the spike protein of coronavirus is responsible for binding to host cellular receptors and the following fusion between the viral envelope and the cellular membrane (Hofmann and Pohlmann, 2004) . The identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has provided insights into the host range, cell tropism and pathogenesis of this newly identified etiological agent. Binding analyses (Babcock et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004) localized a 193 amino-acid (residues 318-510) receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein. This fragment was shown to bind ACE2 more potently than the full-length S1 domain, and an initial search for S-protein residues critical to receptor-binding also pinpointed GLU452 and ASP454 within this fragment. However, the exact residues within S1 and ACE2 involved in their interaction still remain largely undetermined (Hofmann and Pohlmann, 2004) . Since previous structural bioinformatics technology has showed its great power in the study of SARS-CoV (Cai et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004a,b; Zhang and Yap, 2004; , we expect a molecular docking model (PDB code: 1XJP) of S1/ACE2 complex presented here will be helpful to uncover amino acid residues potentially crucial for the association between S1 and ACE2."
1506,860994,"The first morphotype involves the formation of negatively curved membranes, initiated by invaginations of the pre-existing membrane bilayer and giving rise to spherules, vesicles or vacuoles towards the lumen of the targeted cell organelle. These structures have been identified in a broad range of mammalian, plant and insect cells infected with viruses belonging to supergroups II and III. The second strategy involves the formation of membranes with positive curvature, giving rise to double-membrane structures that are the predominant characteristic of the replication factories of the picorna-like virus supergroup. The conservation of these two sorts of morphotypes in distantly related viruses supports the assumption of an evolutionary conserved mechanism. A striking finding in this regard was the observation that HCV, despite belonging to the flavi-like supergroup, induces DMVs whereas flaviviruses induce the formation of negatively curved membranes. To our current knowledge, HCV is the only member of the family Flaviviridae inducing the formation of membrane structures with positive curvature, suggesting that HCV might share common host cell pathways to induce membranous replication compartments with distantly related viruses such as corona-, arteri-, picorna-, calivi-or closteroviruses (Table 1) . However, it still remains to be elucidated whether other members of the family Flaviviridae, belonging to the genera Pestivirus and Pegivirus, also utilize a picorna-like membrane remodeling strategy. A common feature associated with the spherule/vesicle/vacuole/-type of rearranged membranes is their size (50-150 nm diameter) and the presence of a pore connecting the interior of the vesicle with the cytoplasm [15, 20, 60, 88] . Since RNA replication occurs in the vesicle interior, the pore allows exchange of nucleotides and RNA products with the cytoplasm. The size of the pore is variable, ranging from 4.4 nm in case of IBV-induced spherules to ~10 nm in case of membrane invaginations induced by flaviviruses. In contrast, in the majority of DMVs no such channel or pore has been detected. Nevertheless, as exemplified with nidoviruses, the inner compartments enclosed by interconnected DMVs contain the bulk of dsRNA [63] , and in some cases they depict an electron-dense core assumed to correspond to viral RNA (IBV and EAV) [67, 69] . Although this represents a functional enigma in terms of RNA synthesis and transport, the presence of dsRNA in the DMV interior does not necessarily indicate active RNA replication. Assuming a temporal regulation, it is possible that DMVs might be sites of RNA synthesis as long as they are linked to the cytoplasm, but replication would stop upon closure of the vesicles. Yet, another strategy appears to be used by enteroviruses, where active RNA replication has been detected on the cytosolic side of the membranous structures [71, 120] , consistent with the membrane topology of the nonstructural proteins catalyzing RNA replication [121] [122] [123] . As described above, studies conducted with picornaviruses revealed that the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis coincides with the accumulation of single-membrane tubules [79, 80] . Importantly, pulse-radiolabeling experiments localized sites of active RNA replication to the outer surface of single-membrane tubules [71] and isolation of the membranous replication factories and their subsequent visualization by EM revealed that they form rosette-like structures composed of virus-induced cytoplasmic vesicles [124] . RNA replication is thought to occur at sites where the vesicles cluster, whereas RNA translation probably takes place on the exposed periphery of the vesicles. This raises the question, what the role of DMVs in the replication cycle of picornaviruses might be. It is possible that DMVs either support RNA synthesis or serve as RNA storage sites (especially in case of closed DMVs). In this manner, DMVs might be involved in regulating viral RNA replication: by complete sealing of the viral replicase inside the vesicle, it would be inactive, thus regulating overall RNA copy number in the infected cell. Alternatively, DMVs might be an epiphenomenon, resulting from the over-expression of membrane-active proteins that accumulate especially during the late stages of infection."
1507,1882638,"To further assess the RNA-binding affinity of SUD and SUDc5b, a radioactive RNA probe (named bbc3-G 14 ) containing 14 G bases and flanking regions (a total of 48 bases) from the bbc3 gene (nucleotides 983-1030) was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from a synthetic deoxynucleotide duplex template harbouring the T7 promoter [22] . As a control for the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction, an RNA probe (bbc3-A 14 ) containing an A 14 -string instead of G 14 was prepared in a similar manner. An electropho-retic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to probe the interaction between SUD proteins and RNAs. To prevent non-specific binding of radioactive RNA probes to the proteins, a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled tRNA was added to the reaction mixtures. As can be seen from Fig. 4A , full-length SUD is able to retard the mobility of the radioactive bbc3-G 14 RNA in a concentration-dependent manner (lanes 1-4) . An anti-Nsp3 antibody that had been tested for specific interaction with SUD (see Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6) , but not an irrelevant anti-T7 RNA polymerase antibody, supershifts the migration of the SUD-RNA complex (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 and 8, respectively) , implying direct and highly specific interaction between SUD and bbc3-G 14 . Both full-length SUD (Fig. 4A, lanes 2-4 and 6) and SUDc5b (Fig. 4B, lane 1) are able to retard the electrophoretic mobility of free bbc3-G 14 RNA due to RNA-protein complex formation. In contrast, bbc3-A 14 RNA is unable to form a similar complex either with full-length SUD (Fig. 4B , lane 4) or with SUDc5b (Fig. 4B, lane 5) , thus confirming the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction. Interestingly, the appearance of an additional, extremely slow-migrating band was observed with SUDc5b and bbc3-G 14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 1, asterisk) , but not with bbc3-A 14 RNA (lane 5). This is possibly due to a multimerization of a specific RNA-protein complex. The ability of SUDc5b to form multimers in presence of (dG) 8 was confirmed by dynamic light-scattering (Fig. S3B) . No interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA), included as a further control of specificity, with bbc3-G 14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 2) or with bbc3-A 14 RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 6 ) was detectable."

The virus was first identified in The Netherlands in 2001, and shown to cause acute respiratory tract infections in children ( Van den Hoogen et al., 2001) . Since then, surveillance studies have demonstrated that virtually all children are infected with hMPV between the ages 5 and 10 years (Ebihara et al., 2003; Leung et al., 2005; Wolf et al., 2003) . hMPV has subsequently been identified in Asia (Peiris et al., 2003) , Australia (Nissen et al., 2002) , North America (Bastien et al., 2003; Esper et al., 2003; Peret et al., 2002) and Brazil (Cuevas et al., 2003) , where it has been linked to respiratory illness ranging from upper respiratory tract infection to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia, in patients of all age groups. Sequence analysis has revealed two major subgroups (A and B), each with two minor genetic clusters (A1, A2 and B1, B2) ( Van den Hoogen et al., 2004) .

Here, we show that the intestines of virus-infected bats that were also infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more viral RNA than bats with virus alone. Increased viral RNA in the intestines correlated with the severity of fungus-related pathology. Additionally, the intestines of bats infected with fungus exhibited different expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and cytokine related transcripts, irrespective of viral presence. Levels of coronavirus antibodies were also higher in fungal-infected bats. Our results suggest that the systemic effects of WNS may down-regulate anti-viral responses in bats persistently infected with M. lucifugus coronavirus and increase the potential of virus shedding."

All experimental procedures were approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAUSW-2018-005). Twelve 5-day-old piglets were purchased from a commercial pig farm and were randomly divided into two groups, which were housed in separated containments. Prior to PDCoV inoculation, piglets were confirmed to be negative for PDCoV, PEDV, TGEV, and rotavirus by testing rectal swabs by RT-PCR. Neutralizing antibodies against PDCoV were not detected in sera of the piglets or sows. After acclimation for 24 h, the challenged group was inoculated orally with a CHN-HG-2017 preparation with a titer of 1 × 10 6 TCID 50 /ml (10 ml per pig), while the mock-infected group was inoculated with 10 ml of maintenance medium. Clinical symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and appetite loss, were observed and recorded daily. Rectal swabs were collected daily from each piglet from the first day postinoculation (DPI) to the end of the experiment. Swabs were submerged into 1 ml of PBS immediately after collection. Randomly selected piglets from each group (n = 3) were subjected to necropsy at 4 DPI, and prolonged PDCoV shedding was monitored in the remaining pigs until 21 DPI. At necropsy, tissues of duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, rectum, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, and blood were collected for analysis by real-time RT-PCR.

Unfortunately, we did not perform the test for Human Coronaviruses (HCoVs). According to our previous observation, the prevalence of HCoVs infection in children who had acute LRT diseases in Thailand was found to be extremely low. 27 HRV was the most common respiratory pathogen found in 87 samples from 84 patients indicating a prevalence of 30% in this sample population. Two patients had a total of 5 HRV infections between them. Among of HRV positive paediatric patients, 52 and 32 were males and females (1.6:1), respectively. The relationship between HRV characterized in our study and the closest related-prototype strains was investigated based on phylogenetic tree constructions of the VP4 regions ( Fig. 1) and showed that species A and B accounted for 29 (33%) and 8 (9%) specimens, respectively. Most of the HRV positive specimens belonged to a genetically distinct species, HRV-C (58%). The results revealed that HRV-C was the most predominant species responsible for HRV infection and that HRV-B represented a minor species in Thailand."
1515,994845,"In higher organisms, cellular recognition of infection begins with the engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which function by recognising conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), thereby initiating signalling cascades that lead to inflammatory responses. The two major classes of virus-sensing PRRs are the transmembrane Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed on the cell surface or within endosomes, and the retinoic acidinducible gene I (RIG-I)-like RNA helicases (RLHs) which are expressed cytoplasmically. The RLH gene family is evolutionarily ancient and consists of three genes; RIG-I (also known as DDX58), melanoma differentiation associated protein 5 (mda5/IFIH1), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2/DHX58). We previously showed that fruit bats transcribe intact TLRs 1-10 and a TLR13-like pseudogene, and thus possess all of the TLRs believed to be involved in antiviral immunity in other mammals ; however this is the first study to determine whether bats also possess an intact set of RLHs."

On the supply side Albalate et al. (2015) conducted an econometric analysis based on a dataset of air services in Spain. Their study confirms that the supply of airline service measured in number of seats did reduce after the operation of HSR, however, when the supply of air service was measured in flight frequency, the result shows that air service did not suffer a significant reduction.
